reads the state from a given file and compares the expected version against the actual version of the state.
tries to load the latest state from the given data-locations. it tries to load the latest state determined by the states version from one or more data directories and if none of the latest states can be loaded an exception is thrown to prevent accidentally loading a previous state and silently omitting the latest state.
writes the given state to the given directories. the state is written to a state directory (@value #state_dir_name) underneath each of the given file locations and is created if it doesn't exist. the state is serialized to a temporary file in that directory and is then atomically moved to it's target filename of the pattern prefixversion.st.
verifies that when there is a full match (syncid and files) we allocate it to matching node.
when there is no decision or throttle decision across all nodes for the shard, make sure the shard moves to the ignore unassigned list.
when we can't find primary data, but still find replica data, we go ahead and keep it unassigned to be allocated. this is today behavior, which relies on a primary corruption identified with adding a replica and having that replica actually recover and cause the corruption to be identified see corruptfiletest#

split the list of node shard states into groups yesnothrottle based on allocation deciders
builds a map of nodes to the corresponding allocation decisions for those nodes.
builds a list of nodes. if matchanyshard is set to false, only nodes that have an allocation id matching insyncallocationids are added to the list. otherwise, any node that has a shard is added to the list, but entries with matching allocation id are always at the front of the list.
finds the store for the assigned shard in the fetched data, returns null if none is found.
is the allocator responsible for allocating the given shardrouting?
process existing recoveries of replicas and see if we need to cancel them if we find a better match. today, a better match is one that has full sync id match compared to not having one in the previous recovery.

process any changes needed to the allocation based on this fetch result.
called by the response handler of the async action to fetch data. verifies that its still working on the same cache generation, otherwise the results are discarded. it then goes and fills the relevant data for the shard (response + failures), issuing a reroute at the end of it to make sure there will be another round of allocations taking this new data into account.
returns the number of async fetches that are currently ongoing.
are there any nodes that are fetching data?
finds all the nodes that need to be fetched. those are nodes that have no data, and are not in fetch mode.
fetches the data for the relevant shard. if there any ongoing async fetches going on, or new ones have been initiated by this call, the result will have no data.  the ignorenodes are nodes that are supposed to be ignored for this round, since fetching is async, we need to keep them around and make sure we add them back when all the responses are fetched and returned.
fills the shard fetched data with new (data) nodes and a fresh nodeentry, and removes from it nodes that are no longer part of the state.

loads the current meta state for each index in the new cluster state and checks if it has to be persisted. each index state that should be written to disk will be returned. this is only run for data only nodes. it will return only the states for indices that actually have a shard allocated on the current node.
throws an iae if a pre 0.19 state is detected
this test really tests worst case scenario where we have a broken setting or any setting that prevents an index from being allocated in our metadata that we recover. in that case we now have the ability to check the index on local recovery from disk if it is sane and if we can successfully create an indexservice. this also includes plugins etc.

builds the default request handlers
creates a googlecloudstoragefixture
pins the tls trust certificates and, more importantly, overrides connection urls in the case of a custom endpoint setting because some connections don't fully honor this setting (bugs in the sdk). the default connection factory opens a new connection for each request. this is required for the storage instance to be thread-safe.
refreshes the client settings and clears the client cache. subsequent calls to using the parameter settings.
attempts to retrieve a client from the cache. if the client does not exist it will be created from the latest settings and will populate the cache. the returned instance should not be cached by the calling code. instead, for each use, the (possibly updated) instance should be requested by calling this method. (blobs)
creates a client that can be used to manage google cloud storage objects. the client is thread-safe. (blobs)
converts an array of strings to an array of paths, adding an additional child if specified
returns all index paths.
tries to lock the given shards id. a shard lock is required to perform any kind of write operation on a shards data directory like deleting files, creating a new index writer or recover from a different shard instance into it. if the shard lock can not be acquired a shardlockobtainfailedexception is thrown
tries to lock all local shards for the given index. if any of the shard locks can't be acquired a shardlockobtainfailedexception is thrown and all previously acquired locks are released.

returns all currently lock shards. note: the shard ids return do not contain a valid index uuid
returns an array of all of the nodepaths.
this is a best effort to ensure that we actually have write permissions to write in all our data directories. this prevents disasters if nodes are started under the wrong username etc.
resolves all existing paths to indexfoldername in $data.pathsnodesnode.idindices
deletes a shard data directory iff the shards locks were successfully acquired.

returns all folder names in $data.pathsnodesnode.idindices folder
resolve the custom path for a index's shard. uses the indexmetadata.setting_data_path setting to determine the root path for the index.
deletes an indexes data directory recursively. note: this method assumes that the shard lock is acquired
scans the node paths and loads existing metadata file. if not found a new meta data will be generated and persisted into the nodepaths
deletes a shard data directory. note: this method assumes that the shard lock is acquired. this method will also attempt to acquire the write locks for the shard's paths before deleting the data, but this is best effort, as the lock is released before the deletion happens in order to allow the folder to be deleted
this method tries to write an empty file and moves it using an atomic move operation. this method throws an illegalstateexception if this operation is not supported by the filesystem. this test is executed on each of the data directories. this method cleans up all files even in the case of an error.

parses license from json format to an instance of license
this method which chooses the license type randomly if the type is null. however, it will not randomly choose trial or basic types as those types can only be self-generated.
updates the current state of the license, which will change what features are available. may be null if they have never generated a trial license on this cluster, or the most recent trial was prior to this metadata being tracked (6.1)

create an index and index some docs
parse the script configured in the given settings.
helper method to throw an exception if more than one type of script is specified.
this will build scripts into the following xcontent structure: "<(id, source)>" : "", "lang" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... , "params" : "param0" : "", "param1" : "", ... example: "source" : "return math.log(doc.popularity) params.multiplier;", "lang" : "painless", "params" : "multiplier" : 100.0 note that lang, options, and params will only be included if there have been any specified. this also handles templates in a special way. if the script#content_type_option option is provided and the scripttype#inline is specified then the template will be preserved as a raw field. "source" : "query" : ... , "lang" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... , "params" : "param0" : "", "param1" : "", ...
since inline scripts can accept code rather than just an id, they must also be able to handle template parsing, hence the need for custom parsing code. templates can consist of either an string or a json object. if a json object is discovered then the content type option must also be saved as a compiler option.
validates the parameters and creates an script. at run-time this way in case a legacy default language is used from previously stored queries.
constructor for a script that requires the use of compiler options. for scripttype#stored scripts this should be null, but can be specified to access scripts stored as part of the stored scripts deprecated api. the code for this script if the scripttype is scripttype#inline. is scripttype#inline, null otherwise.
creates a script read from an input stream.
this will parse xcontent into a script. the following formats can be parsed: the simple format defaults to an scripttype#inline with no compiler options or user-defined params: example: "return math.log(doc.popularity) 100;" the complex format where scripttype and idorcode are required while lang, options and params are not required. exactly one of "id" or "source" must be specified "id" : "", or "source": "", "lang" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... , "params" : "param0" : "", "param1" : "", ... example: "source" : "return math.log(doc.popularity) params.multiplier", "lang" : "painless", "params" : "multiplier" : 100.0 this also handles templates in a special way. if a complexly formatted query is specified as another complex json object the query is assumed to be a template, and the format will be preserved. "source" : "query" : ... , "lang" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... , "params" : "param0" : "", "param1" : "", ... the one defined by script#default_script_lang due to backwards compatibility requirements related to stored queries using previously default languages.
check whether there have been too many compilations within the last minute, throwing a circuit breaking exception if so. this is a variant of the token bucket algorithm: https:en.wikipedia.orgwikitoken_bucket it can be thought of as a bucket with water, every time the bucket is checked, water is added proportional to the amount of time that elapsed since the last time it was checked. if there is enough water, some is removed and the request is allowed. if there is not enough water the request is denied. just like a normal bucket, if water is added that overflows the bucket, the extra watercapacity is discarded - there can never be more water in the bucket than the size of the bucket.
this configures the maximum script compilations per five minute window.
compiles a script using the given context.
reads an int from the input stream and converts it to a scripttype. if no scripttype is found based on the id.
return the score of the current document.

test that our elements are present in the json output
ensure we can round trip in serialization
ensure no parameters can be null
returns a method with the given name, or throws an exception if multiple are found.
construct a context with the related instance and compiled classes.
this will write xcontent from scriptmetadata. the following format will be written: "" : "< storedscriptsource#toxcontent(xcontentbuilder, params)>", "" : "< storedscriptsource#toxcontent(xcontentbuilder, params)>", ...
delete a script from the existing stored scripts based on a user-specified id.
this will parse xcontent into scriptmetadata. the following format will be parsed: "" : "< storedscriptsource#fromxcontent(xcontentparser, boolean)>", "" : "< storedscriptsource#fromxcontent(xcontentparser, boolean)>", ... when loading from a source prior to 6.0, if multiple scripts using the old namespace id format of [lang#id] are found to have the same id but different languages an error will occur.
convenience method to build and return a new
add a new script to the existing stored scripts based on a user-specified id. if a script with the same id already exists it will be overwritten.
convenience method to build and return a new
validates the parameters and creates an storedscriptsource. this allow empty templates to be loaded for backwards compatibility. this allow empty templates to be loaded for backwards compatibility.
this will write xcontent from a storedscriptsource. the following format will be written: "script" : "lang" : "", "source" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... note that the 'source' parameter can also handle templates written as complex json.
writes a storedscriptsource to a stream. will write all of the lang, source, and options parameters.
since stored scripts can accept templates rather than just scripts, they must also be able to handle template parsing, hence the need for custom parsing source. templates can consist of either an string or a json object. if a json object is discovered then the content type option must also be saved as a compiler option.
reads a storedscriptsource from a stream. version 5.3+ will read all of the lang, source, and options parameters. for versions prior to 5.3, only the source parameter will be read in as a bytes reference.
this will parse xcontent into a storedscriptsource. the following formats can be parsed: the simple script format with no compiler options or user-defined params: example: "script": "return math.log(doc.popularity) 100;" the above format requires the lang to be specified using the deprecated stored script namespace (as a url parameter during a put request). see scriptmetadata for more information about the stored script namespaces. the complex script format using the new stored script namespace where lang and source are required but options is optional: "script" : "lang" : "", "source" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... example: "script": "lang" : "painless", "source" : "return math.log(doc.popularity) params.multiplier" the use of "source" may also be substituted with "code" for backcompat with 5.3 to 5.5 format. for example: "script" : "lang" : "", "code" : "", "options" : "option0" : "", "option1" : "", ... note that the "source" parameter can also handle template parsing including from a complex json object.
converts a parseexception at compile-time or link-time to a scriptexception
this is a hack for filter scripts, which must return booleans instead of doubles as expression do. see https:github.comelasticelasticsearchissues26429.
parses a restrequest body and returns a multisearchtemplaterequest
for simplicity we create a minimal response, as there is already a dedicated test class for search response parsing and serialization.
note that we can't rely on normal equals and hashcode checks, since searchresponse doesn't currently implement equals and hashcode. instead, we compare the template outputs for equality, and perform some sanity checks on the search response instances.
compile a template string to (in this case) a mustache object than can later be re-used for execution to fill in missing parameter values.
test that template can be expressed as a single escaped string.
test that template can contain conditional clause. in this case it is at the beginning of the string.

called by indexshard to record estimated bytes written to translog for the operation
ask this shard to refresh, in the background, to free up heap
tests that if an index structure creation fails on relocation to a new node, the shard is not stuck but properly failed.
deletes an index that is not assigned to this node. this method cleans up all disk folders relating to the index but does not deal with in-memory structures. for those call #removeindex(index, indexremovalreason, string)
creates a new mapper service for the given index, in order to do administrative work like mapping updates. this should not be used for document parsing. doing so will result in an exception. note: the returned mapperservice should be closed when unneeded.
this method verifies that the given metadata holds sane values to create an indexservice. this method tries to update the meta data of the created indexservice if the given metadataupdate is different from the given metadata. this method will throw an exception if the creation or the update fails. the created indexservice will not be registered and will be closed immediately.
deletes the shard with an already acquired shard lock.
cache something calculated at the shard level.
this creates a new indexservice without registering it
processes all pending deletes for the given index. this method will acquire all locks for the given index and will process all pending deletes for this index. pending deletes might occur if the os doesn't allow deletion of files because they are used by a different process ie. on windows where files might still be open by a virus scanner. on a shared filesystem a replica might not have been closed when the primary is deleted causing problems on delete calls so we schedule there deletes later.
returns an indexservice for the specified index if exists otherwise a indexnotfoundexception is thrown.
clears the caches for the given shard id if the shard is still allocated on this node
loads the cache result, computing it if needed by executing the query phase and otherwise deserializing the cached value into the searchcontext#queryresult() context's query result. the combination of load + compute allows to have a single load operation that will cause other requests with the same key to wait till its loaded an reuse the same cache.
can the shard request be cached at all?
checks if changes (adding removing) indices, shards and so on are allowed.
creates a new pending delete of an index
this method deletes the shard contents on disk for the given shard id. this method will fail if the shard deleting is prevented by #candeleteshardcontent(shardid, indexsettings) of if the shards lock can not be acquired. on data nodes, if the deleted shard is the last shard folder in its index, the method will attempt to remove the index folder as well.
returns sharddeletioncheckresult signaling whether the shards content for the given shard can be deleted.
deletes the index store trying to acquire all shards locks for this index. this method will delete the metadata for the index even if the actual shards can't be locked. package private for testing
adds a pending delete for the given index shard.
verify that the contents on disk for the given index is deleted; if not, delete the contents. this method assumes that an index is already deleted in the cluster state andor explicitly through index tombstones.
creates a new indexservice for the given metadata. per-index listeners
returns an indexservice for the specified index if exists otherwise returns null.
this method returns true if the current node is allowed to delete the given index. this is the case if the index is deleted in the metadata or there is no allocation on the local node and the index isn't on a shared file system.
clear all entries that belong to the given index.
get usage statistics for the given shard.
this test checks an edge case where, if a node had an index (lets call it a with uuid 1), then deleted it (so a tombstone entry for a will exist in the cluster state), then created a new index a with uuid 2, then shutdown, when the node comes back online, it will look at the tombstones for deletions, and it should proceed with trying to delete a with uuid 1 and not throw any errors that the index still exists in the cluster state. this is a case of ensuring that tombstones that have the same name as current valid indices don't cause confusion by trying to delete an index that exists. see https:github.comelasticelasticsearchissues18054
tests that teh mapperservice created by indicesservice#createindexmapperservice(indexmetadata) contains custom types and similarities registered by plugins
read from a stream.
issues a cache clear and waits 30 seconds for the field data breaker to be cleared
returns true if any of the nodes used a noop breaker
relocate a shard and block cluster state processing on the relocation target node to activate the shard
test that we can safely concurrently index and get stats. this test was inspired by a serialization issue that arose due to a race getting doc stats during heavy indexing. the race could lead to deleted docs being negative which would then be serialized as a variable-length long. since serialization of negative longs using a variable-length format was unsupported ( org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.streamoutput#writevlong(long)), the stream would become corrupted. here, we want to test that we can continue to get stats while indexing.
closes the current recovery target and waits up to a certain timeout for resources to be freed. returns true if resetting the recovery was successful, false if the recovery target is already cancelled failed or marked as done.
creates a new recovery target object that represents a recovery to the provided shard. version; necessary for primary relocation so that new primary knows about all other ongoing replica recoveries when replicating documents (see recoverysourcehandler)
mark the current recovery as done
creates an org.apache.lucene.store.indexoutput for the given file name. note that the indexoutput actually point at a temporary file.  note: you can use #getopenindexoutput(string) with the same filename to retrieve the same indexoutput at a later stage
fail the recovery and call listener
cancel the recovery. calling this method will clean temporary files and release the store unless this object is in use (in which case it will be cleaned once all ongoing users call  if #cancellablethreads() was used, the threads will be interrupted.
fail the recovery with the given id (if found) and remove it from the recovery collection
cancel the recovery with the given id (if found) and remove it from the recovery collection
gets the recoverytarget for a given id. the recoverystatus returned has it's ref count already incremented to make sure it's safe to use. however, you must call recoverytarget#decref() when you are done with it, typically by using this method in a try-with-resources clause.  returns null if recovery is not found
mark the recovery with the given id as done (if found)
cancel all ongoing recoveries for the given shard
resets the recovery and performs a recovery restart on the currently recovering index shard

construct a request for starting a peer recovery.
performs the recovery from the local engine to the target
send the given snapshot's operations with a sequence number greater than the specified staring sequence number to this handler's target node.  operations are bulked into a single request depending on an operation count limit or size-in-bytes limit. total number of operations sent
perform phase two of the recovery process.  phase two uses a snapshot of the current translog without acquiring the write lock (however, the translog snapshot is point-in-time view of the translog). it then sends each translog operation to the target node so it can be replayed into the new shard. ops should be sent
perform phase1 of the recovery operations. once this indexcommit snapshot has been performed no commit operations (files being fsync'd) are effectively allowed on this index until all recovery phases are done  phase1 examines the segment files on the target node and copies over the segments that are missing. only segments that have the same size and checksum can be reused
determines if the source translog is ready for a sequence-number-based peer recovery. the main condition here is that the source translog contains all operations above the local checkpoint on the target. we already know the that translog contains or will contain all ops above the source local checkpoint, so we can stop check there.
tests scenario where recovery target successfully sends recovery request to source but then the channel gets closed while the source is working on the recovery process.
obtains a snapshot of the store metadata for the recovery target.
get the starting sequence number for a sequence-number-based request. failed
prepare the start recovery request.
this test makes sure that there is no infinite loop of flushing (the condition `shouldperiodicallyflush` eventually is false) in peer-recovery if a primary sends a fully-baked index commit.

checks if cluster state matches internal state of indicesclusterstateservice instance
finds the routing source node for peer recovery, return null if its not found. note, this method expects the shard routing to require peer recovery, use shardrouting#recoverysource() to check if its needed or not.
deletes indices (with shard data).
returns shard for the specified id if it exists otherwise returns null.
removes shard entries from the failed shards cache that are no longer allocated to this node by the master. sends shard failures for shards that are marked as actively allocated to this node but don't actually exist on the node. resends shard failures for shards that are still marked as allocated to this node but previously failed.
notifies master about shards that don't exist but are supposed to be active on this node.
removes shards that are currently loaded by indicesservice but have disappeared from the routing table of the current node. this method does not delete the shard data.
removes indices that have no shards allocated to this node. this does not delete the shard data as we wait for enough shard copies to exist in the cluster before deleting shard data (triggered by org.elasticsearch.indices.store.indicesstore).
in rare cases it is possible that a nodes gets an instruction to replace a replica shard that's in post_recovery with a new initializing primary with the same allocation id. this can happen by batching cluster states that include the starting of the replica, with closing of the indices, opening it up again and allocating the primary shard to the node in question. the node should then clean it's initializing replica and replace it with a new initializing primary.
this test ensures that when a node joins a brand new cluster (different cluster uuid), different from the cluster it was previously a part of, the in-memory index data structures are all removed but the on disk contents of those indices remain so that they can later be imported as dangling indices. normally, the first cluster state update that the node receives from the new cluster would contain a cluster block that would cause all in-memory structures to be removed (see indicesclusterstateservice#applyclusterstate(clusterchangedevent)), but in the case where the node joined and was a few cluster state updates behind, it would not have received the cluster block, in which case we still need to remove the in-memory structures while ensuring the data remains on disk. this test executes this particular scenario.
prepares the settings by gathering all elasticsearch system properties, optionally loading the configuration settings.

provides a reproducible source of randomness seeded by a long seed in the settings with the key setting.
provides a source of randomness that is reproducible when running under the elasticsearch test suite, and otherwise produces a non-reproducible source of randomness. reproducible sources of randomness are created when the system property "tests.seed" is set and the security policy allows reading this system property. otherwise, non-reproducible sources of randomness are created. to acquire an instance of random from randomizedcontext or tests are running but tests.seed is not set

format the double value with a single decimal points, trimming trailing '.0'.
trim all occurrences of the supplied leading character from the given string.
take a string which is a delimited list and convert it to a string array. a single delimiter can consists of more than one character: it will still be considered as single delimiter string, rather than as bunch of potential delimiter characters - in contrast to tokenizetostringarray. rather than a bunch individual delimiter characters) line breaks: e.g. "\r\n\f" will delete all new lines and line feeds in a string.

convenience method to return a string array as a delimited (e.g. csv) string. e.g. useful for tostring() implementations.
replace all occurrences of a substring within a string with another string.
splits a backslash escaped string on the separator.  current backslash escaping supported:  \n \t \r \b \f are escaped the same as a java string  other characters following a backslash are produced verbatim (\c => c)
check whether the given charsequence has actual text. more specifically, returns true if the string not null, its length is greater than 0, and it contains at least one non-whitespace character.  stringutils.hastext(null) = false stringutils.hastext("") = false stringutils.hastext(" ") = false stringutils.hastext("12345") = true stringutils.hastext(" 12345 ") = true  its length is greater than 0, and it does not contain whitespace only
return a string that is the json representation of the provided toxcontent. wraps the output into an anonymous object if needed. allows to control whether the outputted json needs to be pretty printed and human readable.

truncates string to a length less than length. backtracks to throw out high surrogates.
test whether the given string matches the given substring at the given index.
tokenize the given string into a string array via a stringtokenizer. trims tokens and omits empty tokens. the given delimiters string is supposed to consist of any number of delimiter characters. each of those characters can be used to separate tokens. a delimiter is always a single character; for multi-character delimiters, consider using delimitedlisttostringarray (each of those characters is individually considered as delimiter).
match a string against the given pattern, supporting the following simple pattern styles: "xxx", "xxx", "xxx" and "xxxyyy" matches (with an arbitrary number of pattern parts), as well as direct equality.
add a sequence of validation errors to the accumulating validation errors

check that a directory exists, is a directory and is readable by the current user
appends the path to the given base and strips n elements off the path if strip is > 0.
check whether the file denoted by the given path is hidden. in practice, this will check if the file name starts with a dot. this should be preferred to files#ishidden(path) as this does not depend on the operating system.
returns an inputstream the given url if the url has a protocol of 'file' or 'jar', no host, and no port.
returns a path from a uri  this works just like paths.get().  remember: this should almost never be used. usually resolve a path against an existing one!

writes a java.nio.bytebuffer to a java.nio.channels.writablebytechannel
read from a file channel into a byte buffer, starting at a certain position. an eofexception will be thrown if you attempt to read beyond the end of file.
read length bytes from position of a file channel
flushes the internal bytes buffer.
writes a portion of a string.
writes the specified character sequence.
sets the output stream to use for writing until this writer is closed. for example:[code] writer writer = new utf8streamwriter().setoutputstream(out); [code] is equivalent but writes faster than [code] writer writer = new java.io.outputstreamwriter(out, "utf-8"); [code] it has not been #close closed or #reset reset.
closes and #reset resets this writer for reuse.
flushes the stream. if the stream has saved any characters from the various write() methods in a buffer, write them immediately to their intended destination. then, if that destination is another character or byte stream, flush it. thus one flush() invocation will flush all the buffers in a chain of writers and outputstreams.
writes a collection of generic objects via a writer
write a map of k-type keys to v-type.  map<string, string> map = ...; out.writemap(map, streamoutput::writestring, streamoutput::writestring); 
writes a list of writeable objects
writes a list of streamable objects
writes a non-negative long in a variable-length format. writes between one and ten bytes. smaller values take fewer bytes. negative numbers use ten bytes and trip assertions (if running in tests) so prefer #writelong(long) or #writezlong(long) for negative numbers.
write map to stream with consistent order to make sure every map generated bytes order are same. this method is compatible with streaminput.readmap and streaminput.readgenericvalue this method only will handle the map keys order, not maps contained within the map
writes an optional bytes reference including a length header. use this if you need to differentiate between null and empty bytes references. use #writebytesreference(bytesreference) and streaminput#readbytesreference() if you do not.
notice: when serialization a map, the stream out map with the stream in map maybe have the different key-value orders, they will maybe have different stream order. if want to keep stream out map and stream in map have the same stream order when stream, can use writemapwithconsistentorder
writes the bytes reference, including a length header.
writes the specified array to the stream using the specified writer for each element in the array. this method can be seen as writer version of streaminput#readarray(writeable.reader, intfunction). the length of array encoded as a variable-length integer is first written to the stream, and then the elements of the array are written to the stream.
serializes a potential null value.
constructs a new registry from the given entries.
returns a reader for a namedwriteable object identified by the name provided as argument and its category.
creates a new inputstreamstreaminput with a size limit
read a map of k-type keys to v-type lists.  map<string, list<string>> map = in.readmapoflists(streaminput::readstring, streaminput::readstring); 
reads an array from the stream using the specified org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.writeable.reader to read array elements from the stream. this method can be seen as the reader version of streamoutput#writearray(writeable.writer, object[]). it is assumed that the stream first contains a variable-length integer representing the size of the array, and then contains that many elements that can be read from the stream.
reads a list of namedwriteables.
reads an enum with type e that was serialized based on the value of it's ordinal
reads a long stored in variable-length format. reads between one and ten bytes. smaller values take fewer bytes. negative numbers are encoded in ten bytes so prefer #readlong() or #readzlong() for negative numbers.
reads a collection of objects
read a list of streamable objects, using the constructor to instantiate each instance.  this is expected to take the form:  list<mystreamableclass> list = in.readstreamlist(mystreamableclass::new); 
reads an enum with type e that was serialized based on the value of it's ordinal
serializes a potential null value.
reads a bytes reference from this stream, might hold an actual reference to the underlying bytes of the stream.
reads an int stored in variable-length format. reads between one and five bytes. smaller values take fewer bytes. negative numbers will always use all 5 bytes and are therefore better serialized using #readint
read a timevalue from the stream
reads a namedwriteable from the current stream with the given name. it is assumed that the caller obtained the name from other source, so it's not read from the stream. the name is used for looking for the corresponding entry in the registry by name, so that the proper object can be read and returned. default implementation throws unsupportedoperationexception as streaminput doesn't hold a registry. use filterinputstream instead which wraps a stream and supports a namedwriteableregistry too. prefer streaminput#readnamedwriteable(class) and streamoutput#writenamedwriteable(namedwriteable) unless you have a compelling reason to use this method instead.
reads a vint via #readvint() and applies basic checks to ensure the read array size is sane. this method uses #ensurecanreadbytes(int) to ensure this stream has enough bytes to read for the read array size.
checks for a deprecated setting and logs the correct alternative
checks for a removed setting and logs the correct alternative

get the set of core cache keys associated with the given index.
returns an iterable that allows to iterate over all files in this segments info
check whether there is one or more documents matching the provided query.
this method removes all files from the given directory that are not referenced by the given segments file. this method will open an indexwriter and relies on index file deleter to remove all unreferenced files. segment files that are newer than the given segments file are removed forcefully to prevent problems with indexwriter opening a potentially broken commit point leftover. note: this method will fail if there is another indexwriter open on the given directory. this method will also acquire a write lock from the directory while pruning unused files. this method expects an existing index in the given directory that has the given segments file.
return a scorer that throws an elasticsearchillegalstateexception on all operations with the given message.
given a scorersupplier, return a bits instance that will match all documents contained in the set. note that the returned bits instance must be consumed in order.
this method removes all lucene files from the given directory. it will first try to delete all commit points segments files to ensure broken commits or corrupted indices will not be opened in the future. if any of the segment files can't be deleted this operation fails.
returns the number of documents in the index referenced by this segmentinfos
tries to extract a segment reader from the given index reader. if no segmentreader can be extracted an illegalstateexception is thrown.

test that core cache key (needed for nrt) is working
initialize lookup for the provided segment
returns the internal lucene doc id for the given id bytes.
return null if id is not found.
return null if id is not found. we pass the leafreadercontext as an argument so that things still work with reader wrappers that hide some documents while still using the same cache key. otherwise we'd have to disable caching entirely for these readers.
load the internal doc id and sequence number for the uid from the reader, returning null if the uid wasn't found, a doc id and the associated seqno otherwise 
load the primaryterm associated with the given docidandseqno
load the internal doc id and version for the uid from the reader, returning null if the uid wasn't found, a doc id and a version otherwise

return a query that will return docs like the passed lucene document id.
find words for a more-like-this query former. the result is a priority queue of arrays with one entry for every word in the document. each array has 6 elements. the elements are:   the word (string)  the top field that this word comes from (string)  the score for this word (float)  the idf value (float)  the frequency of this word in the index (integer)  the frequency of this word in the source document (integer)  this is a somewhat "advanced" routine, and in general only the 1st entry in the array is of interest. this method is exposed so that you can identify the "interesting words" in a document. for an easier method to call see #retrieveinterestingterms retrieveinterestingterms().
convenience routine to make it easy to return the most interesting words in a document. more advanced users will call #retrieveterms(reader, string) retrieveterms() directly.
return a query that will return docs like the passed readers. this was added in order to treat multi-value fields.
return a query that will return docs like the passed fields.

put an entry into the segment
the cache statistics tracking hits, misses and evictions. these are taken on a best-effort basis meaning that they could be out-of-date mid-flight.
remove an entry from the segment
get an entry from the segment; expired entries will be returned as null but not removed from the cache until the lru list is pruned or a manual cache#refresh() is performed however a caller can take action using the provided callback
remove an entry from the segment iff the future is done and the value is equal to the expected value

if the specified key is not already associated with a value (or is mapped to null), attempts to compute its value using the given mapping function and enters it into this map unless null. the load method for a given key will be invoked at most once. use of different cacheloader implementations on the same key concurrently may result in only the first loader function being called and the second will be returned the result provided by the first including any exceptions thrown during the execution of the first.
force any outstanding size-based and time-based evictions to occur
an lru sequencing of the values in the cache. this sequence is not protected from mutations to the cache (except for iterator#remove(). the result of iteration under any other mutation is undefined.

adapts an array (or varags) setter into a list setter.
makes sure that current token is of type token#field_name and the field name is equal to the provided one
parse the current token depending on its token type. the following token types will be parsed by the corresponding parser methods:   token#value_string: xcontentparser#text()  token#value_number: xcontentparser#numbervalue() ()  token#value_boolean: xcontentparser#booleanvalue() ()  token#value_embedded_object: xcontentparser#binaryvalue() ()  token#value_null: returns null  token#start_object: xcontentparser#mapordered() ()  token#start_array: xcontentparser#listorderedmap() () 
makes sure that provided token is of the expected type
this method expects that the current field name is the concatenation of a type, a delimiter and a name (ex: terms#foo where "terms" refers to the type of a registered namedxcontentregistry.entry, "#" is the delimiter and "foo" the name of the object to parse). it also expected that following this field name is either an object or an array xcontent structure and the cursor points to the start token of this structure. the method splits the field's name to extract the type and name and then parses the object using the xcontentparser#namedobject(class, string, object) method. from the field's name
returns a binary content builder for the provided content type.
constructs a xcontent builder that will output the result into the provided output stream.
guesses the content type based on the provided bytes and returns the corresponding xcontent from headers. till we fixed the rest layer to read the content-type header, that should be the only place where guessing is needed.
guesses the content (type) based on the provided char sequence and returns the corresponding xcontent the rest layer should move to reading the content-type header instead. there are other places where auto-detection may be needed. this method is deprecated to prevent usages of it from spreading further without specific reasons.

attempts to match the given media type with the known xcontenttype values. this match is done in a case-insensitive manner. the provided media type should not include any parameters. this method is suitable for parsing part of the content-type http header. this method will return null if no match is found
accepts either a format string, which is equivalent to xcontenttype#shortname() or a media type that optionally has parameters and attempts to match the value to an xcontenttype. the comparisons are done in lower case format and this method also supports a wildcard accept for application. this method can be used to parse the accept http header or a format query string parameter. this method will return null if no match is found
finish parsing the object.
creates the consumer that does the "field just arrived" behavior. if the targetobject hasn't been built then it queues the value. otherwise it just applies the value just like objectparser does.
call this to do the actual parsing. this implements bifunction for conveniently integrating with objectparser.
set a constructor argument and build the target object if all constructor arguments have arrived.
queue a consumer that we'll call once the targetobject is built. if targetobject has been built this will fail because the caller should have just applied the consumer immediately.
build the parser. objectparser. from external systems, never when parsing requests from users. the parser, casting the elements of the array to the arguments so they work with your favorite constructor. the objects in the array will be in the same order that you declared the #constructorarg()s and none will be null. the second argument is the value of the context provided to the #parse(xcontentparser, object) parse function. if any of the constructor arguments aren't defined in the xcontent then parsing will throw an error. we use an array here rather than a

test that accounting on whether or not a thread holds a releasable lock is correct. previously we had a bug where on a re-entrant lock that if a thread entered the lock twice we would declare that it does not hold the lock after it exits its first entrance but not its second entrance.
breaks this barrier if it has been reset or broken for any other reason.  note: this call is not atomic in respect to awaitreset calls. a breakifbroken() may be context switched to invoke a reset() prior to await(). this resets the barrier to its initial state - parties not currently waiting at the barrier will not be accounted for! an await that wasn't time limited, will block indefinitely.
sometimes wraps a runnable in an abstractrunnable.
adds the given item to the queue. the listener is notified once the item is processed
 this overrides the default behavior of onafter to add the caveat that it only runs if the #lifecycle is not stopped or closed.  note: this does not guarantee that it won't be stopped concurrently as it invokes #onafterinlifecycle(), but it's a solid attempt at preventing it. for those that use this for rescheduling purposes, the next invocation would be effectively cancelled immediately if that's the case.
 this invokes #doruninlifecycle() only if the #lifecycle is not stopped or closed. otherwise it exits immediately.
sets the element at position i to the given value.
copies the content of the underlying atomic array to a normal one.
returns the it as a non null list.
removes the current context and resets a new context that contains a merge of the current headers and the given headers. the removed context can be restored when closing the returned storedcontext. the merge strategy is that headers that are already existing are preserved unless they are defaults.
same as #newrestorablecontext(boolean) but wraps an existing context to restore.
saves the current thread context and wraps command in a runnable that restores that context before running command. if command has already been passed through this method then it is returned unaltered rather than wrapped twice.

build the updater responsible for validating new values, logging the new value, and eventually setting the value where it belongs.
returns a new copy of this object that is backed by its own char array. closing the new instance has no effect on the instance it was created from. this is useful for apis which accept a char array and you want to be safe about the api potentially modifying the char array. for example:  try (securestring copy = securestring.clone()) pass thee char[] to a external api passwordauthentication auth = new passwordauthentication(username, copy.getchars()); ... 
constant time equality to avoid potential timing attacks.
throw an exception if this string has been closed, indicating something is trying to access the data after being closed.
it is possible to retrieve the setting names even if the keystore is closed. this allows securesetting to correctly determine that a entry exists even though it cannot be read. thus attempting to read a secure setting after the keystore is closed will generate a "keystore is closed" exception rather than using the fallback setting.

constructs a new keystore with the given password.
merge the given secure settings into this one.
adds a settings consumer for affix settings. affix settings have a namespace associated to it that needs to be available to the consumer in order to be processed correctly. this consumer will get a namespace to value map instead of each individual namespace and value as in #addaffixupdateconsumer(setting.affixsetting, biconsumer, biconsumer)
adds a settings consumer with a predicate that is only evaluated at update time.  note: only settings registered in settingsmodule can be changed dynamically.  this is useful to add additional validation to settings at runtime compared to at startup time.

adds a settings consumer for affix settings. affix settings have a namespace associated to it that needs to be available to the consumer in order to be processed correctly.
archives invalid or unknown settings. any setting that is not recognized or fails validation will be archived. this means the setting is prefixed with @value archived_settings_prefix and remains in the settings object. this can be used to detect invalid settings via apis. associated value) associated value and an exception)
adds a settings consumer that accepts the values for two settings. the consumer is only notified if one or both settings change and if the provided validator succeeded.  note: only settings registered in settingsmodule can be changed dynamically.  this method registers a compound updater that is useful if two settings are depending on each other. the consumer is always provided with both values even if only one of the two changes.
applies the given settings to all the settings consumers or to none of them. the settings will be merged with the node settings before they are applied while given settings override existing node settings.

returns the value for the given setting.
validates that all settings are registered and valid.
registers a settings filter pattern that allows to filter out certain settings that for instance contain sensitive information or if a setting is for internal purposes only. the given pattern must either be a valid settings key or a simple regexp pattern.
registers a new setting. this method should be used by plugins in order to expose any custom settings the plugin defines. unless a setting is registered the setting is unusable. if a setting is never the less specified the node will reject the setting during startup.

this method can be used to parse a getresponse object when it has been printed out as a xcontent using the #toxcontent(xcontentbuilder, params) method.  for forward compatibility reason this method might not fail if it tries to parse a field it doesn't know. but before returning the result it will check that enough information were parsed to return a valid getresponse instance and throws a parsingexception otherwise. this is the case when we get a 404 back, which can be parsed as a normal of this method needs a way to figure out whether we got back a valid get response, which can be done by catching parsingexception.

returns the string value for the specified index and setting. if the includedefaults flag was not set or set to false on the getsettingsrequest, this method will only return a value where the setting was explicitly set on the index. if the includedefaults flag was set to true on the getsettingsrequest, this method will fall back to return the default value if the setting was not explicitly set.
if the newly created index matches with an index template whose aliases contains the rollover alias, the rollover alias will point to multiple indices. this causes indexing requests to be rejected. to avoid this, we make sure that there is no duplicated alias in index templates before creating a new index.
adds condition to check if the index has at least numdocs
adds a size-based condition to check if the index size is at least size.
adds condition to check if the index is at least age old
sets the number of shard copies that must be active before getting the health status. defaults to activeshardcount#none, meaning we don't wait on any active shards. set this value to activeshardcount#all to wait for all shards (primary and all replicas) to be active across all indices in the cluster. otherwise, use total number of shard copies that would exist across all indices in the cluster.

registers recording task event listeners with the given action mask on all nodes
very basic "is it plugged in" style test that indexes a document and makes sure that you can fetch the status of the process. the goal here is to verify that the large moving parts that make fetching task status work fit together rather than to verify any particular status results from indexing. for that, look at transportreplicationactiontests. we intentionally don't use the task recording mechanism used in other places in this test so we can make sure that the status fetching works properly over the wire.
returns all events that satisfy the criteria across all nodes
resets all recording task event listeners with the given action mask on all nodes
this test starts nodes actions that blocks on all nodes. while node actions are blocked in the middle of execution it executes a tasks action that targets these blocked node actions. the test verifies that task actions are only getting executed on nodes that are not listed in the node filter.

returns true iff the given cluster state's routing table contains enough active shards for the given indices to meet the required shard count represented by this instance.
parses the active shard count from the given string. valid values are "all" for all shard copies, null for the default value (which defaults to one shard copy), or a numeric value greater than or equal to 0. any other input will throw an illegalargumentexception.
get an activeshardcount instance for the given value. the value is first validated to ensure it is a valid shard count and throws an illegalargumentexception if validation fails. valid values are any non-negative number. directly use activeshardcount#default for the default value (which is one shard copy) or activeshardcount#all to specify all the shards.
returns true iff the given number of active shards is enough to meet the required shard count represented by this instance. this method should only be invoked with activeshardcount objects created from #from(int), or #none or #one.

sets the current phase on the task if it isn't null. pulled into its own method because its more convenient that way.
tries to acquire reference to indexshard to perform a primary operation. released after performing primary operation locally and replication of the operation to all replica shards is completed failed (see replicationoperation).
resolves derived values in the request. for example, the target shard id of the incoming request, if not set at request construction. additional processing or validation of the request should be done here.
this test ensures that replication operations adhere to the indexmetadata#setting_wait_for_active_shards setting when the request is using the default value for waitforactiveshards.
transport channel that is needed for replica operation testing.
when relocating a primary shard, there is a cluster state update at the end of relocation where the active primary is switched from the relocation source to the relocation target. if relocation source receives and processes this cluster state before the relocation target, there is a time span where relocation source believes active primary to be on relocation target and relocation target believes active primary to be on relocation source. this results in replication requests being sent back and forth.  this test checks that replication request is not routed back from relocation target to relocation source in case of stale index routing table on relocation target.

rethrow task failures if there are any.
allows to directly call transportmasternodeaction#masteroperation(masternoderequest, clusterstate, actionlistener) which is a protected method.
indexing operations which entail mapping changes require a blocking request to the master node to update the mapping. if the master node is being disrupted or if it cannot commit cluster state changes, it needs to retry within timeout limits. this retry logic is implemented in transportmasternodeaction and tested by the following master failover scenario.

prepares an update request by converting it into an index or delete request or an update response (no action).
sets a threshold that enforces a pre-filter roundtrip to pre-filter search shards based on query rewriting if the number of shards the search request expands to exceeds the threshold. this filter roundtrip can limit the number of shards significantly if for instance a shard can not match any documents based on it's rewrite method ie. if date filters are mandatory to match but the shard bounds and the query are disjoint. the default is 128
constructs a new search request from reading the specified stream.
sets the number of shard results that should be reduced at once on the coordinating node. this value should be used as a protection mechanism to reduce the memory overhead per search request if the potential number of shards in the request can be large.
sets the number of shard requests that should be executed concurrently on a single node. this value should be used as a protection mechanism to reduce the number of shard requests fired per high level search request. searches that hit the entire cluster can be throttled with this number to reduce the cluster load. the default is 5
constructs a new search request against the provided indices with the given search source.
executes a single request from the queue of requests. when a request finishes, another request is taken from the queue. when a request is executed, a permit is taken on the specified semaphore, and released as each request completes.

reduces the given query results and consumes all aggregations and profile results. from all non-null query results. from all non-null query results.
returns a score doc array of top n search docs across all shards, followed by top suggest docs for each named completion suggestion across all shards. if more than one named completion suggestion is specified in the request, the suggest docs for a named suggestion are ordered by the suggestion name. note: the order of the sorted score docs depends on the shard index in the result array if the merge process needs to disambiguate the result. in oder to obtain stable results the shard index (index of the result in the result array) must be the same. enabled only for scroll search, because that only retrieves hits of length 'size' in the query phase.
performs an intermediate reduce phase on the aggregations. for instance with this reduce phase never prune information that relevant for the final reduce step. for final reduce see #reduceaggs(list, list, reducecontext)

releases shard targets that are not used in the docsidstoload.
this method collects nodes from the remote clusters asynchronously if any of the scroll ids references a remote cluster. otherwise the action listener will be invoked immediately with a function based on the given discovery nodes.
this method should be called if a search phase failed to ensure all relevant search contexts and resources are released. this method will also notify the listener and sends back a failure to the user.
this is the main entry point for a search. this method starts the search execution of the initial phase.
add a search request to execute. note, the order is important, the search response will be returned in the same order as the search requests.  if ignoreindices has been set on the search request, then the indicesoptions of the multi search request will not be used (if set).

checks and returns the status of the existing index in this store.
deletes all corruption markers from this store.
returns a new metadatasnapshot for the given commit. if the given commit is null the latest commit point is used. note that this method requires the caller verify it has the right to access the store and no concurrent file changes are happening. if in doubt, you probably want to use one of the following: directory only be used if there is no started shard using this store. unexpected exception when opening the index reading the segments file.
repairs the index using the previous returned status from #checkindex(printstream).
keeping existing unsafe commits when opening an engine can be problematic because these commits are not safe at the recovering time but they can suddenly become safe in the future. the following issues can happen if unsafe commits are kept oninit.  1. replica can use unsafe commit in peer-recovery. this happens when a replica with a safe commit c1(max_seqno=1) and an unsafe commit c2(max_seqno=2) recovers from a primary with c1(max_seqno=1). if a new document(seqno=2) is added without flushing, the global checkpoint is advanced to 2; and the replica recovers again, it will use the unsafe commit c2(max_seqno=2 at most gcp=2) as the starting commit for sequenced-based recovery even the commit c2 contains a stale operation and the document(with seqno=2) will not be replicated to the replica.  2. min translog gen for recovery can go backwards in peer-recovery. this happens when are replica with a safe commit c1(local_checkpoint=1, recovery_translog_gen=1) and an unsafe commit c2(local_checkpoint=2, recovery_translog_gen=2). the replica recovers from a primary, and keeps c2 as the last commit, then sets last_translog_gen to 2. flushing a new commit on the replica will cause exception as the new last commit c3 will have recovery_translog_gen=1. the recovery translog generation of a commit is calculated based on the current local checkpoint. the local checkpoint of c3 is 1 while the local checkpoint of c2 is 2.  3. commit without translog can be used in recovery. an old index, which was created before multiple-commits is introduced (v6.2), may not have a safe commit. if that index has a snapshotted commit without translog and an unsafe commit, the policy can consider the snapshotted commit as a safe commit for recovery even the commit does not have translog.
marks this store as corrupted. this method writes a corrupted_$uuid file containing the given exception message. if a store contains a corrupted_$uuid file #ismarkedcorrupted() will return true.
reads a metadatasnapshot from the given index locations or returns an empty snapshot if it can't be read.
force bakes the given translog generation as recovery information in the lucene index. this is used when recovering from a snapshot or peer file based recovery where a new empty translog is created and the existing lucene index needs should be changed to use it.
returns the segments info for the given commit or for the latest commit if the given commit is null
marks an existing lucene index with a new history uuid. this is used to make sure no existing shard will recovery from this index using ops based recovery.
checks that the lucene index contains a history uuid marker. if not, a new one is generated and committed.
renames all the given files from the key of the map to the value of the map. all successfully renamed files are removed from the map in-place.
the returned indexoutput validates the files checksum.  note: checksums are calculated by default since version 4.8.0. this method only adds the verification against the checksum in the given metadata and does not add any significant overhead.
returns a diff between the two snapshots that can be used for recovery. the given snapshot is treated as the recovery target and this snapshot as the source. the returned diff will hold a list of files that are:  identical: they exist in both snapshots and they can be considered the same ie. they don't need to be recovered different: they exist in both snapshots but their they are not identical missing: files that exist in the source but not in the target  this method groups file into per-segment files and per-commit files. a file is treated as identical if and on if all files in it's group are identical. on a per-segment level files for a segment are treated as identical iff:  all files in this segment have the same checksum all files in this segment have the same length the segments .si files hashes are byte-identical note: this is a using a perfect hash function, the metadata transfers the .si file content as it's hash   the .si file contains a lot of diagnostics including a timestamp etc. in the future there might be unique segment identifiers in there hardening this method further.  the per-commit files handles very similar. a commit is composed of the segments_n files as well as generational files like deletes ( _x_y.del) or field-info ( _x_y.fnm) files. on a per-commit level files for a commit are treated as identical iff:  all files belonging to this commit have the same checksum all files belonging to this commit have the same length the segments file segments_n files hashes are byte-identical note: this is a using a perfect hash function, the metadata transfers the segments_n file content as it's hash   note: this diff will not contain the segments.gen file. this file is omitted on recovery.

tests retry mechanism when indexing. if an exception occurs when indexing then the indexing request is tried again before finally failing. if auto generated ids are used this must not lead to duplicate ids see https:github.comelasticelasticsearchissues8788
tests corruption that happens on a single shard when no replicas are present. we make sure that the primary stays unassigned and all other replicas for the healthy shards happens
this test triggers a corrupt index exception during finalization size if an empty commit point is transferred during recovery we don't know the version of the segments_n file because it has no segments we can take it from. this simulates recoveries from old indices or even without checksums and makes sure if we fail during finalization we also check if the primary is ok. without the relevant checks this test fails with a red cluster
tests corruption that happens on the network layer and that the primary does not get affected by corruption that happens on the way to the replica. the file on disk stays uncorrupted
tests that restoring of a corrupted shard fails and we get a partial snapshot. todo once checksum verification on snapshotting is implemented this test needs to be fixed or split into several parts... we should also corrupt files on the actual snapshot and check that we don't restore the corrupted shard.
prunes the list of index files such that only the latest del generation files are contained.
this test verifies that if we corrupt a replica, we can still get to green, even though listing its store fails. note, we need to make sure that replicas are allocated on all data nodes, so that replica won't be sneaky and allocated on a node that doesn't have a corrupted replica.
tests that we can actually recover from a corruption on the primary given that we have replica shards around.

resolves the current version of the document, returning null if not found
returns true if the indexing operation may have already be processed by this engine. note that it is ok to rarely return true even if this is not the case. however a `false` return value must always be correct.
closes the engine without acquiring the write lock. this should only be called while the write lock is hold or in a disaster condition ie. if the engine is failed.
reads the current stored translog id from the last commit data.
asserts that the doc in the index operation really doesn't exist
captures the most recent commit point #lastcommit or the most recent safe commit point #safecommit. index files of the capturing commit point won't be released until the commit reference is closed.
find the highest index position of a safe index commit whose max sequence number is not greater than the global checkpoint. index commits with different translog uuid will be filtered out as they don't belong to this engine.
checks if the deletion policy can release some index commits with the latest global checkpoint.
releases an index commit that acquired by #acquireindexcommit(boolean).
find a safe commit point from a list of existing commits based on the supplied global checkpoint. the max sequence number of a safe commit point should be at most the global checkpoint. if an index was created before v6.2, and we haven't retained a safe commit yet, this method will return the oldest commit.
end the recovery counter by decrementing the store's ref and the ongoing recovery counter
return a tuple representing the sequence id for the given get operation. the first value in the tuple is the sequence number, the second is the primary term.

return stats
returns the minimum file generation referenced by the translog
creates a new translog instance. this method will create a new transaction log unless the given transloggeneration is the generation is not null, this method tries to open the given translog generation. the generation is treated as the last generation referenced from already committed data. this means all operations that have not yet been committed should be in the translog file referenced by this generation. the translog creation will fail if this generation can't be opened. deleted examined and stored in the header whenever a new generation is rolled. it's guaranteed from outside that a new generation is rolled when the term is increased. this guarantee allows to us to validate and reject operation whose term is higher than the primary term stored in the translog header.
trims translog for terms of files below belowterm and seq# above aboveseqno. effectively it moves max visible seq# checkpoint#trimmedaboveseqno therefore translogsnapshot skips those operations.
acquires a lock on the translog files, preventing them from being trimmed
returns the number of operations in the transaction files that contain operations with seq# above the given number.

returns the size in bytes of the translog files at least the given generation
recover all translog files found on disk
reads a list of operations written with #writeoperations(streamoutput, list)
closes the translog if the current translog writer experienced a tragic exception. note that in case this thread closes the translog it must not already be holding a read lock on the translog as it will acquire a write lock in the course of closing the translog
sync's the translog.
roll the current translog generation into a new generation. this does not commit the translog.
reads and returns the operation from the given location if the generation it references is still available. otherwise this method will return null.
ensures that all locations in the given stream have been synced written to the underlying storage. this method allows for internal optimization to minimize the amount of fsync operations if multiple locations must be synced.
adds an operation to the transaction log.
writes all operations in the given iterable to the given output stream including the size of the array use #readoperations(streaminput, string) to read it back.
returns the generation of the current transaction log.
extracts the translog generation from a file name.
returns true iff the given generation is the current generation of this translog
the last synced checkpoint for this translog.
gets the minimum generation that could contain any sequence number after the specified sequence number, or the current generation if there is no generation that could any such sequence number.
returns the current generation of this translog. this corresponds to the latest uncommitted translog generation
creates a new writer needed to solve and initialization problem while constructing an empty translog. with no readers and no current, a call to #getminfilegeneration() would not work.
sets the tragic exception or if the tragic exception is already set adds passed exception as suppressed exception
read the size of the op (i.e., number of bytes, including the op size) written at the given position
reads an operation at the given position and returns it. the buffer length is equal to the number of bytes reads.
given a file channel, opens a translogreader, taking care of checking and validating the file header.
reads an operation at the given position into the given buffer.
closes current reader and creates new one with new checkoint and same file channel
disables translog flushing for the specified index

marks this sequence number and returns true if it is seen before.
lists all existing commits in a given index path, then read the minimum translog generation that will be used in recoverfromtranslog.
corrupts random translog file (translog-n.tlog) from the given translog directory.
make sure that it's ok to close a translog snapshot multiple times
tests that closing views after the translog is fine and we can reopen the translog
tests that concurrent readers and writes maintain view and snapshot semantics
this test adds operations to the translog which might randomly throw an ioexception. the only thing this test verifies is that we can, after we hit an exception, open and recover the translog successfully and retrieve all successfully synced operations from the transaction log.
tests the situation where the node crashes after a translog gen was committed to lucene, but before the translog had the chance to clean up its files.
tests the situation where the node crashes after a translog gen was committed to lucene, but before the translog had the chance to clean up its files.

write a translog containing the given translog uuid to the given location. returns the number of bytes written.
promotes the specific replica as the new primary
test request failures (failures before seq_no generation) are not added as a noop to translog
this test ensures the consistency between primary and replica when non-append-only (eg. index request with id or delete) operation of the same document is processed before the original append-only request on replicas. the append-only document can be exposed and deleted on the primary before it is added to replica. replicas should treat a late append-only request as a regular index request.
this test ensures the consistency between primary and replica with late and out of order delivery on the replica. an index operation on the primary is followed by a delete operation. the delete operation is delivered first and processed on the replica but the index is delayed with an interval that is even longer the gc deletes cycle. this makes sure that that replica still remembers the delete operation and correctly ignores the stale index operation.
test document failures (failures after seq_no generation) are added as noop operation to the translog for primary and replica shards
metric implementing precision@k. ratings equal or above this value will be considered relevant. controls how unlabeled documents in the search hits are treated. set to 'true', unlabeled documents are ignored and neither count as true or false positives. set to 'false', they are treated as false positives. controls the window size for the search results the metric takes into account

test that the relevant rating threshold can be set to something larger than 1. e.g. we set it to 2 here and expect dics 0-2 to be not relevant, doc 3 and 4 to be relevant
test cases retrieves all six documents indexed above. the first part checks the prec@10 calculation where all unlabeled docs are treated as "unrelevant". we average prec@ metric across two search use cases, the first one that labels 4 out of the 6 documents as relevant, the second one with only one relevant document.
test that running a bad query (e.g. one that will target a non existing field) will produce an error in the response
this test assumes we are using the same ratings as in discountedcumulativegaintests#testdcgat(). see details in that test case for how the expected values are calculated
test that multiple indices work, setting indices options is possible and works as expected
test that the relevant rating threshold can be set to something larger than 1. e.g. we set it to 2 here and expect dics 0-2 to be not relevant, so first relevant doc has third ranking position, so rr should be 13
create searchhits for testing, starting from dociid 'from' up to docid 'to'. the search hits index also need to be provided

run a search action and call onresponse when a the response comes in, retrying if the action fails with an exception caused by rejected execution.
we can't send parsesearchrequest rest content that it doesn't support so we will have to remove the content that is valid in addition to what it supports from the content first. this is a temporary hack and should get better when searchrequest has full objectparser support then we can delegate and stuff.
read from a stream.
takes an action created by a bulkbyscrolltask and runs it with regard to whether the request is sliced or not. if the request is not sliced (i.e. the number of slices is 1), the worker action in the given runnable will be started on the local node. if the request is sliced (i.e. the number of slices is more than 1), then a subrequest will be created for each slice and sent. if slices are set as "auto", this class will resolve that to a specific number based on characteristics of the source indices. a request with "auto" slices may end up being sliced or unsliced.
slice a search request into times separate search requests slicing on field. note that the slices are shallow copies of this request so don't change them.
make sure that search failures get pushed back to the user as failures of the whole process. we do lose some information about how far along the process got, but its important that they see these failures.

process a scroll response.
processes bulk responses, accounting for failures.
prepare the bulk request. called on the generic thread pool after some preflight checks have been done one the searchresponse and any delay has been slept. uses the generic thread pool because reindex is rare enough not to need its own thread pool and because the thread may be blocked by the user script.
assert that two task statuses are equal after serialization.
maximum number of processed documents. defaults to -1 meaning process all documents.
append a short description of the search request to a stringbuilder. used to make tostring.
set the throttle for this request in sub-requests per second. float#positive_infinity means set no throttle and that is the default. throttling is done between batches, as we start the next scroll requests. that way we can increase the scroll's timeout to make sure that it contains any time that we might wait.
the number of slices this task should be divided into. defaults to 1 meaning the task isn't sliced into subtasks.
sets abortonversionconflict based on rest-friendly names.
constructor for actual use. request slicing
setup a clone of this request with the information needed to process a slice of it.
set the throttle to apply to all matching requests in sub-requests per second. float#positive_infinity means set no throttle. throttling is done between batches, as we start the next scroll requests. that way we can increase the scroll's timeout to make sure that it contains any time that we might wait.
execute a bulk retry test case. the total number of failures is random and the number of retries attempted is set to testrequest.getmaxretries and controled by the failwithrejection parameter.
mimicks search timeouts.
mimicks bulk indexing failures.
tests that we can cancel the request during its throttling delay. this can't use #canceltaskcase(consumer) because it needs to send the request un-canceled and cancel it at a specific time.
mimicks bulk rejections. these should be retried and eventually succeed.
tests that each scroll response is a batch and that the batch is launched properly.
mimicks script failures or general wrongness by implementers.
mimicks a threadpool rejecting execution of the task.
mimicks shard search failures usually caused by the data node serving the scroll request going down.
simulate a scroll response by setting the scroll id and firing the onscrollresponse method.
the default retry time matches what we say it is in the javadoc for the request.
test rethrottling.
overrides the parent's implementation is much more updatereindex oriented and so also copies things like timestampttl which we don't care for a deletion.
schedule preparebulkrequestrunnable to run after some delay. this is where throttling plugs into reindexing so the request can be rescheduled over and over again.
apply newrequestspersecond as the new rate limit for this task's search requests

furiously rethrottles a delayed request to make sure that we never run it twice.
yank a string array from a map. emulates xcontent's permissive string to string array conversions.
build a remoteinfo, defaulting values that we don't care about in this test to values that don't hurt anything.
sets common options of abstractbulkbyscrollrequest requests.
test for parsing _ttl, _timestamp, _routing, and _parent.
creates a hit source that doesn't make the remote request and instead returns data from some files. also requests are always returned synchronously rather than asynchronously.
test for parsing _ttl, _routing, and _parent. _timestamp isn't available.
versions of elasticsearch before 2.1.0 don't support sort:_doc and instead need to use search_type=scan. scan doesn't return documents the first iteration but reindex doesn't like that. so we jump start strait to the next iteration.
wrap the responseexception in an exception that'll preserve its status code if possible so we can send it back to the user. we might not have a constant for the status code so in that case we just use 500 instead. we also extract make sure to include the response body in the message so the user can figure out why the remote elasticsearch service threw the error back to us.

test one can snapshot the store at various lifecycle stages
simulates a scenario that happens when we are async fetching snapshot metadata from gatewayservice and checking index concurrently. this should always be possible without any exception.
this test makes sure that people can use the shard routing entry + take an operation permit to check whether a shard was already promoted to a primary.
here we are simulating the scenario that happens when we do async shard fetching from gatewayserivce while we are finishing a recovery and concurrently clean files. this should always be possible without any exception. yet there was a bug where indexshard acquired the index writer lock before it called into the store that has it's own locking for metadata reads

check that the accounting breaker correctly matches the segments api for memory usage
attempts to add a listener at the same time as a refresh occurs by having a background thread force a refresh as fast as it can while adding listeners. this can catch the situation where a refresh happens right as the listener is being added such that the listener misses the refresh and has to catch the next one. if the listener wasn't able to properly catch the next one then this would fail.
uses a bunch of threads to index, wait for refresh, and non-realtime get documents to validate that they are visible after waiting regardless of what crazy sequence of events causes the refresh listener to fire.
the number of pending listeners.
fire some listeners. does nothing if the list of listeners is null.
add a listener for refreshes, calling it immediately if the location is already visible. if this runs out of listener slots then it forces a refresh and calls the listener immediately as well. false otherwise.
add a global checkpoint listener. if the global checkpoint is above the current global checkpoint known to the listener then the listener will be asynchronously notified on the executor used to construct this collection of global checkpoint listeners. if the shard is closed then the listener will be asynchronously notified on the executor used to construct this collection of global checkpoint listeners. the listener will only be notified of at most one event, either the global checkpoint is updated or the shard is closed. a listener must re-register after one of these events to receive subsequent events.
parse the string representation of this shardid back to an object. we lose index uuid information here, but since we use tostring in rest responses, this is the best we can do to reconstruct the object on the client side.

this method tries to delete left-over shards where the index name has been reused but the uuid is different to allow the new shard to be allocated.
this method walks through the nodes shard paths to find the data and state path for the given shard. if multiple directories with a valid shard state exist the one with the highest version will be used. note: this method resolves custom data locations for the shard.
construct operation permits for the specified shards.
obtain the active operation count, or zero if all permits are held (even if there are outstanding operations in flight).
immediately delays operations and on another thread waits for in-flight operations to finish and then executes onblocked under the guarantee that no new operations are started. delayed operations are run after onblocked has executed. after operations are delayed and the blocking is forked to another thread, returns to the caller. if a failure occurs while blocking operations or executing onblocked then the onfailure handler will be invoked.

class invariant that should hold before and after every invocation of public methods on this class. as java lacks implication as a logical operator, many of the invariants are written under the form (!a || b), they should be read as (a implies b) however.
if we do not update the global checkpoint in replicationtracker#markallocationidasinsync(string, long) after adding the allocation id to the in-sync set and removing it from pending, the local checkpoint update that freed the thread waiting for the local checkpoint to advance could miss updating the global checkpoint in a race if the waiting thread did not add the allocation id to the in-sync set and remove it from the pending set before the local checkpoint updating thread executed the global checkpoint update. this test fails without an additional call to replicationtracker#updateglobalcheckpointonprimary() after removing the allocation id from the pending set in replicationtracker#markallocationidasinsync(string, long) (even if a call is added after notifying all waiters in replicationtracker#updatelocalcheckpoint(string, long)).

test that adding an additional object within each object of the otherwise correct query always triggers some kind of parse exception. some specific objects do not cause any exception as they can hold arbitrary content; they can be declared by overriding #getobjectsholdingarbitrarycontent().
call this method to check a valid json string representing the query under test against it's generated json. note: by the time of this writing (nov 2015) all queries are taken from the query dsl reference docs mirroring examples there. here's how the queries were generated:   take a reference documentation example.  stick it into the createparseablequeryjson method of the respective query test.  manually check that what the querybuilder generates equals the input json ignoring default options.  put the manual checks into the assertqueryparsedfromjson method.  now copy the generated json including default options into createparseablequeryjson  by now the roundtrip check for the json should be happy. 
checks the result of querybuilder#toquery(queryshardcontext) given the original querybuilder and queryshardcontext. verifies that named queries and boost are properly handled and delegates to
test that wraps the randomly generated query into an array as follows: "query_name" : [] this causes unexpected situations in parser code that may not be handled properly.
generic test that creates new query from the test query and checks both for equality and asserts equality on the two queries.
this test ensures that queries that need to be rewritten have dedicated tests. these queries must override this method accordingly.
traverses the json tree of the valid query provided as argument and mutates it one or more times by adding one object within each object encountered. for instance given the following valid term query: "term" : "field" : "value" : "foo" the following two mutations will be generated, and an exception is expected when trying to parse them: "term" : "newfield" : "field" : "value" : "foo" "term" : "field" : "newfield" : "value" : "foo" every mutation is then added to the list of results with a boolean flag indicating if a parsing exception is expected or not for the mutation. some specific objects do not cause any exception as they can hold arbitrary content; they are passed using the arbitrarymarkers parameter.

randomly adds fields, objects, or arrays to the provided builder. the maximum depth is 5.
returns a random source in a given xcontenttype containing a random number of fields, objects and array, with maximum depth 5. the minimum number of fields per object is provided as an argument.
this method takes the input xcontent data and adds a random field value, inner object or array into each json object. this can e.g. be used to test if parsers that handle the resulting xcontent can handle the augmented xcontent correctly, for example when testing lenient parsing. if the xcontent output contains objects that should be skipped of such treatment, an optional filtering this predicate should check the xcontent path that we want to insert to and return true if the path should be excluded. paths are string concatenating field names and array indices, so e.g. in:  "foo1 : "bar" : [ ... , ... , "baz" : insert here ]  "foo1.bar.2.baz" would point to the desired insert location. to exclude inserting into the "foo1" object we would user a predicate like  (path) -> path.endswith("foo1")  or if we don't want any random insertions in the "foo1" tree we could use  (path) -> path.contains("foo1") 
this utility method takes an xcontentparser and walks the xcontent structure to find all possible paths to where a new object or array starts. this can be used in tests that add random xcontent values to test parsing code for errors or to check their robustness against new fields. the path uses dot separated fieldnames and numbers for array indices, similar to what we do in the stack passed in should initially be empty, it gets pushed to by recursive calls as an example, the following json xcontent:  "foo" : "bar", "foo1" : [ 1, "foo2" : "baz" , 3, 4] "foo3" : "foo4" : "foo5": "buzz"  would return the following list:  "" (the empty string is the path to the root object) "foo1.1" "foo3 "foo3.foo4 
inserts keyvalue pairs into xcontent passed in as bytesreference and returns a new xcontentbuilder the paths argument uses dot separated fieldnames and numbers for array indices, similar to what we do in the keyvalue arguments can suppliers that either return fixed or random values.

asserts that all shards are allocated on nodes matching the given node pattern.
indexes the given indexrequestbuilder instances randomly. it shuffles the given builders and either indexes them in a blocking or async fashion. this is very useful to catch problems that relate to internal document ids or index segment creations. some features might have bug when a given document is the first or the last in a segment or if only one document is in a segment etc. this method prevents issues like this by randomizing the index layout. all documents are indexed. this is useful to produce deleted documents on the server side.

convert the entity from a response into a map of maps.
is this template one that is automatically created by xpack?
waits until all shard initialization is completed. this is a handy alternative to ensuregreen as it relates to all shards in the cluster and doesn't require to know how many nodesreplica there are.
waits for the cluster state updates to have been processed, so that no cluster state updates are still in-progress when the next test starts.
does the cluster being tested have xpack installed?
logs a message if there are still running tasks. the reasoning is that any tasks still running are state the is trying to bleed into other tests.

this test tries to simulate load while creating an index and indexing documents while the index is being created.
this method sets the context for a server socket channel. the context is called when a new channel is accepted, an exception occurs, or it is time to close the channel.
this method will attempt to complete the connection process for this channel. it should be called for new channels or for a channel that has produced a op_connect event. if this method returns true then the connection is complete and the channel is ready for reads and writes. if it returns false, the channel is not yet connected and this method should be called again when a op_connect event is received.
this method is called after events (read, write, connect) have been handled for a channel.
this method is called when a niochannel is being registered with the selector. it should only be called once per channel.
this method is called when a niosocketchannel has just been accepted or if it has receive an op_connect event.
this method handles the closing of an niochannel
this will create an niogroup with dedicated acceptors. all server channels will be handled by a group of selectors dedicated to accepting channels. these accepted channels will be handed off the non-server selectors.
returns a boolean indicating if the operation was fully flushed.
this method will return an array of bytebuffer representing the bytes from the index passed through the end of this buffer. the buffers will be duplicates of the internal buffers, so any modifications to the markers bytebuffer#position(), bytebuffer#limit(), etc will not modify the this class.
this method will release bytes from the head of this buffer. if you release bytes past the current index the index is truncated to zero.
this method will return an array of bytebuffer representing the bytes from the beginning of this buffer up through the index argument that was passed. the buffers will be duplicates of the internal buffers, so any modifications to the markers bytebuffer#position(),
this method will return an array of page representing the bytes from the beginning of this buffer up through the index argument that was passed. the pages and buffers will be duplicates of the internal components, so any modifications to the markers bytebuffer#position(), retain the underlying pages, so the pages returned by this method must be closed.
this method cleans up any context resources that need to be released when a channel is closed. it should only be called by the selector thread.
executes a failed listener with consistent exception handling. this can only be called from current selector thread.
queues a write operation directly in a channel's buffer. if this channel does not have pending writes already, the channel will be flushed. channel buffers are only safe to be accessed by the selector thread. as a result, this method should only be called by the selector thread. if this channel does not have pending writes already, the channel will be flushed.
executes a success listener with consistent exception handling. this can only be called from current selector thread.
starts this selector. the selector will run until #close() is called.
queues a write operation to be handled by the event loop. this can be called by any thread and is the api available for non-selector threads to schedule writes.
this is a convenience method to be called after some object (normally channels) are enqueued with this selector. this method will check if the selector is still open. if it is open, normal operation can proceed. if the selector is closed, then we attempt to remove the object from the queue. if the removal succeeds then we throw an illegalstateexception indicating that normal operation failed. if the object cannot be removed from the queue, then the object has already been handled by the selector and operation can proceed normally. if this method is called from the selector thread, we will not allow the queuing to occur as the selector thread can manipulate its queues internally even if it is no longer open.
schedules a niochannel to be registered with this selector. the channel will by queued and eventually registered next time through the event loop.

schedules a one-shot command to run after a given delay. the command is not run in the context of the calling thread. to preserve the context of the calling thread you may call threadpool.getthreadcontext().preservecontext on the runnable before passing it to this method. meaning of the scheduledfuture returned by this method. in that case the scheduledfuture will complete only when the command completes. the task is canceled before it was added to its target thread pool. once the task has been added to its target thread pool the scheduledfuture will cannot interact with it.
returns true if the given service was terminated successfully. if the termination timed out, the service is null this method will return false.
get the executorservice with the given name. this executor service's  warning: this executorservice might not throw rejectedexecutionexception if you submit a task while it shutdown. it will instead silently queue it and not run it.
returns true if the given pool was terminated successfully. if the termination timed out, the service is null this method will return false.
construct a fixed executor builder.
creates a new rescheduling runnable and schedules the first execution to occur after the interval specified
returns an implementation that checks for each fixed interval if there are threads that have invoked #register() and not #unregister() and have been in this state for longer than the specified max execution interval and then interrupts these threads.
checks whether patterns reference each other in a circular manner and if so fail with an exception in a pattern, anything between % and  or : is considered a reference to another named pattern. this method will navigate to all these named patterns and check for a circular reference.
checks whether a specific text matches the defined grok expression.
matches and returns any named captures within a compiled grok expression that matched within the provided text.
converts a grok expression into a named regex expression
read from a stream.
return an extraction for the conjunction of result1 and result2 by picking up clauses that look most restrictive and making it unverified if the other clause is not null and doesn't match all documents. this is used by 6.0.0 indices which didn't use the terms_set query.
extracts terms and ranges from the provided query. these terms and ranges are stored with the percolator query and used by the percolate query's candidate query as fields to be query by. the candidate query holds the terms from the document to be percolated and allows to the percolate query to ignore percolator queries that we know would otherwise never match.  when extracting the terms for the specified query, we can also determine if the percolator query is always going to match. for example if a percolator query just contains a term query or a disjunction query then when the candidate query matches with that, we know the entire percolator query always matches. this allows the percolate query to skip the expensive memory index verification step that it would otherwise have to execute (for example when a percolator query contains a phrase query or a conjunction query).  the query analyzer doesn't always extract all terms from the specified query. for example from a boolean query with no should clauses or phrase queries only the longest term are selected, since that those terms are likely to be the rarest. boolean query's must_not clauses are always ignored.  sometimes the query analyzer can't always extract terms or ranges from a sub query, if that happens then query analysis is stopped and an unsupportedqueryexception is thrown. so that the caller can mark this query in such a way that the percolatorquery always verifies if this query with the memoryindex.
fails if a percolator contains an unsupported query. the following queries are not supported: 1) a has_child query 2) a has_parent query

creates an constantcallsite
links the delegate method to the returned callsite. the linked delegate method will use converted types from the interface method. using invokedynamic to make the delegate method call allows of either a lot more code or requiring many classes to be looked up at link-time.
generates a lambda class for a lambda functionmethod reference within a painless script. variables with the prefix interface are considered to represent values for code generated for the lambda class. variables with the prefix delegate are considered to represent values for code generated within the painless script. the interface method delegates (calls) to the delegate method. captured types are based on the parameters for this method (static, virtual, interface, or constructor) the captured types if the value is '1' if the delegate is an interface and '0' otherwise; note this is an int because the bootstrap method cannot convert constants to boolean that implements the expected functional interface

loads and creates a whitelist from one to many text files. the file paths are passed in as an array of is the path of a single text file. the class's classloader will be used to lookup the java reflection objects for each individual class, constructor, method, and field specified as part of the whitelist in the text file. a single pass is made through each file to collect all the information about each class, constructor, method, and field. most validation will be done at a later point after all whitelists have been gathered and their merging takes place. a painless type name is one of the following:   def - the painless dynamic type which is automatically included without a need to be whitelisted.   fully-qualified java type name - any whitelisted java class will have the equivalent name as a painless type name with the exception that any dollar symbols used as part of inner classes will be replaced with dot symbols.   short java type name - the text after the final dot symbol of any specified java class. a short type java name may be excluded by using the 'no_import' token during painless class parsing as described later.   the following can be parsed from each whitelist text file:   blank lines will be ignored by the parser.   comments may be created starting with a pound '#' symbol and end with a newline. these will be ignored by the parser.   primitive types may be specified starting with 'class' and followed by the java type name, an opening bracket, a newline, a closing bracket, and a final newline.   complex types may be specified starting with 'class' and followed the fully-qualified java class name, optionally followed by an 'no_import' token, an opening bracket, a newline, constructormethodfield specifications, a closing bracket, and a final newline. within a complex type the following may be parsed:   a constructor may be specified starting with an opening parenthesis, followed by a comma-delimited list of painless type names corresponding to the typeclass names for the equivalent java parameter types (these must be whitelisted as well), a closing parenthesis, and a newline.   a method may be specified starting with a painless type name for the return type, followed by the java name of the method (which will also be the painless name for the method), an opening parenthesis, a comma-delimited list of painless type names corresponding to the typeclass names for the equivalent java parameter types (these must be whitelisted as well), a closing parenthesis, and a newline.   an augmented method may be specified starting with a painless type name for the return type, followed by the fully qualified java name of the class the augmented method is part of (this class does not need to be whitelisted), the java name of the method (which will also be the painless name for the method), an opening parenthesis, a comma-delimited list of painless type names corresponding to the typeclass names for the equivalent java parameter types (these must be whitelisted as well), a closing parenthesis, and a newline.  a field may be specified starting with a painless type name for the equivalent java type of the field, followed by the java name of the field (which all be the painless name for the field), and a newline.    note there must be a one-to-one correspondence of painless type names to java typeclass names. if the same painless type is defined across multiple files and the java class is the same, all specified constructors, methods, and fields will be merged into a single painless type. the painless dynamic type, 'def', used as part of constructor, method, and field definitions will be appropriately parsed and handled. painless complex types must be specified with the fully-qualified java class name. method argument types, method return types, and field types must be specified with painless type names (def, fully-qualified, or short) as described earlier. the following example is used to create a single whitelist text file: # primitive types class int -> int # complex types class my.package.example no_import # constructors () (int) (def, def) (example, def) # method example add(int, def) int add(example, example) void example() # augmented example some.other.class sub(example, int, def) # fields int value0 int value1 def value2

creates a new restclient based on the provided configuration.
sets the path's prefix for every request used by the http client.  for example, if this is set to "mypath", then any client request will become "mypath" + endpoint.  in essence, every request's endpoint is prefixed by this pathprefix. the path prefix is useful for when elasticsearch is behind a proxy that provides a base path or a proxy that requires all paths to start with ''; it is not intended for other purposes and it should not be supplied in other scenarios.
creates a new builder instance and sets the hosts that the client will send requests to.

mocks the synchronous request execution like if it was executed by elasticsearch.
the resthighlevelclient must declare the following execution methods using the protected modifier so that they can be used by subclasses to implement custom logic.
mocks the asynchronous request execution by calling the #mockperformrequest(request) method.
creates a resthighlevelclient given the low level restclient that it should use to perform requests and a list of entries that allow to parse custom response sections added to elasticsearch through plugins. this constructor can be called by subclasses in case an externally created low-level rest client needs to be provided. the consumer argument allows to control what needs to be done when the #close() method is called. also subclasses can provide parsers for custom response sections added to elasticsearch through plugins.
converts a responseexception obtained from the low level rest client into an elasticsearchexception. if a response body was returned, tries to parse it as an error returned from elasticsearch. if no response body was returned or anything goes wrong while parsing the error, returns a new elasticsearchstatusexception that wraps the original responseexception. the potential exception obtained while parsing is added to the returned exception as a suppressed exception. this method is guaranteed to not throw any exception eventually thrown while parsing.
loads and returns the namedxcontentregistry.entry parsers provided by plugins.
asserts that the provided exception contains the method that called this somewhere on its stack. this is normally the case for synchronous calls but restclient performs synchronous calls by performing asynchronous calls and blocking the current thread until the call returns so it has to take special care to make sure that the caller shows up in the exception. we use this assertion to make sure that we don't break that "special care".

test that sniffer#close() shuts down the underlying scheduler, and that such calls are idempotent. also verifies that the next scheduled round gets cancelled.
test multiple sniffing rounds by mocking the scheduler as well as the nodessniffer. simulates the ordinary behaviour of sniffer when sniffing on failure is not enabled. the countingnodessniffer doesn't make any network connection but may throw exception or return no nodes, which makes it possible to verify that errors are properly handled and don't affect subsequent runs and their scheduling. the scheduler implementation submits rather than scheduling tasks, meaning that it doesn't respect the requested sniff delays while allowing to assert that the requested delays for each requested run and the following one are the expected values.
here, we verify that the order that we add fields to a document counts, and not the lexi order of the field. this means that heavily accessed fields that use field selector should be added first (with load and break).

construct a channel for handling the request.
a channel level bytes output that can be reused. the bytes output is lazily instantiated by a call to #newbytesoutput(). once the stream is created, it gets reset on each call to this method.
creates a new xcontentbuilder for a response to be sent using this channel. the builder's type is determined by the following logic. if the request has a format parameter that will be used to attempt to map to an xcontenttype. if there is no format parameter, the http accept header is checked to see if it can be matched to a xcontenttype. if this first attempt to map fails, the request content type will be used if the value is not null; if the value is null the output format falls back to json.
add an additional method and handler for an existing path. note that methodhandlers does not allow replacing the handler for an already existing method.
for requests to a valid rest endpoint using an unsupported http method, verify that a 405 http response code is returned, and that the response 'allow' header includes a list of valid http methods for the endpoint (see  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2616#section-10.4.6">http1.1 - 10.4.6 - 405 method not allowed).
create a character array for characters [ from, to].
 usage is logged via the deprecationlogger so that the actual response can be notified of deprecation as well.
this does a very basic pass at validating that a header's value contains only expected characters according to rfc-5987, and those that it references.  https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5987  this is only expected to be used for assertions. the idea is that only readable us-ascii characters are expected; the rest must be encoded with percent encoding, which makes checking for a valid character range very simple.
throw an exception if the value is not a #validheadervalue(string) valid header.
parses a top level query including the query element that wraps it

buildrecoverytable will build a table of recovery information suitable for displaying at the command line.
extracts all the required fields from the restrequest 'h' parameter. in order to support wildcards like 'bulk.' this needs potentially parse all the configured headers and its aliases and needs to ensure that everything is only added once to the returned headers, even if 'h=bulk..bulk.' is specified or some headers are contained twice due to matching aliases

this test verifies that as a cluster is upgraded incrementally, new documents eventually switch over to the "new" form of id (128 bit murmur3 ids). rollup ids are essentially the hashed concatenation of keys returned by the composite aggregation, so the field values that are being indexed (timestamp, value, etc) directly affect the id that is generated. we don't know which node will get the rollup task to start, so we don't know when it will migrate. the first doc is guaranteed to be the "old" style since all nodes are un-upgraded. the second and third phase will have a mixed cluster, and the rollup task may or may not migrate. in those phases we have two options (old and new) for the document added in the phase. the last phase is guaranteed to be new as it's a fully upgraded cluster.

sets the httpasyncclientbuilder#setdefaultcredentialsprovider(credentialsprovider) credential provider,
check and, if necessary, publish this httpresource.  this will perform the check regardless of the #isdirty() dirtiness and it will update the dirtiness. using this directly can be useful if there is ever a need to double-check dirtiness without having to #markdirty() mark it as dirty.  if you do mark this as dirty while this is running (e.g., asynchronously something invalidates a resource), then the resource will still be dirty at the end, but the success of it will still return based on the checks it ran.
determine if the response contains a watch whose value  this expects a response like:  "metadata": "xpack": "version": 6000002 
determine if the current #watchid watch exists.
reach out to the remote cluster to determine the usability of watcher.
determine if watcher exists ( exists) or does not exist ( does_not_exist).
determine if x-pack is installed and, if so, if watcher is both available and enabled so that it can be used.  if it is not both available and enabled, then we mark that it exists so that no follow-on work is performed relative to watcher. we do the same thing if the current node is not the elected master node.
logs every error field's value until it hits the end of an array.
success is relative with bulk responses because unless it's rejected outright, it returns with a 200.  individual documents can fail and since we know how we're making them, that means that .
create a new httphost from the current scheme, host, and port.
set the port for the httphost.  specifying the port as -1 will cause it to be defaulted to 9200 when the httphost is built.
create a new httphost based on the supplied host.
create a new publishablehttpresource.
determine if the current resource should replaced the checked one based on its version (or lack thereof).  this expects a response like (where resourcename is replaced with its value):  "resourcename": "version": 6000002 
determine if the current resourcename exists at the resourcebasepath endpoint.  this provides the base-level check for any resource that cares about existence and also its contents. the response will only ever be null if none was returned.
upload the resourcename to the resourcebasepath endpoint.
determine if the current resourcename exists at the resourcebasepath endpoint with a version greater than or equal to the expected version.  this provides the base-level check for any resource that does not need to care about its response beyond existence (and likely does not need to inspect its contents).  this expects responses in the form of:  "resourcename": "version": 6000002 
delete the resourcename using the resourcebasepath endpoint.  note to callers: this will add an "ignore" parameter to the request so that 404 is not an exception and therefore considered successful if it's not found. you can override this behavior by specifying any valid value for "ignore", at which point 404 responses will result in false and logged failure.
ensure that the response contains a version that is version#onorafter(version) on or after the
verify that the minimum version is supported on the remote cluster.  if it does not, then there is nothing that can be done except wait until it does. there is no publishing aspect to this operation.
check and publish all #resources sub-resources.
if the node is not the elected master node, then it should never check watcher or send watches (cluster alerts).
sets the builder#setconnecttimeout(int) connect timeout and builder#setsockettimeout(int) socket timeout.
adds the resources necessary for checking and publishing cluster alerts.
adds a validator for the #ssl_setting to prevent dynamic updates when secure settings also exist within that setting groups (ssl context). because it is not possible to re-read the secure settings during a dynamic update, we cannot rebuild the ssliosessionstrategy (see #configuresecurity(restclientbuilder, config, sslservice) if this exporter has been configured with secure settings

when on the elected master, we setup all resources (mapping types, templates, and pipelines) before we attempt to run the exporter. if those resources do not exist, then we will create them.
install cluster alerts (watches) into the cluster
create the pipeline required to handle past data as well as to future-proof ingestion for current documents (the pipeline is initially empty, but it can be replaced later with one that translates it as-needed).  this should only be invoked by the elected master node.  whenever we eventually make a backwards incompatible change, then we need to override any pipeline that already exists that is older than this one. this uses the elasticsearch version, down to the alpha portion, to determine the version of the last change.  "description": "...", "pipelines" : [ ... ], "version": 6000001 
when not on the elected master, we require all resources (mapping types, templates, and pipelines) to be available before we attempt to run the exporter. if those resources do not exist, then it means the elected master's exporter has not yet run, so the monitoring cluster (this one, as the local exporter) is not setup yet.
determine if this localexporter is ready to use.
determine if the ingest pipeline for pipelineid exists in the cluster or not with an appropriate minimum version.

cancelstop the cleaning service.  this will kill any scheduled #future from running. it's possible that this will be executed concurrently with the stopped.
set the global retention. this is expected to be used by the cluster settings to dynamically control the global retention time.  even if the current license prevents retention updates, it will accept the change so that they do not need to re-set it if they upgrade their license (they can always unset it).
get the retention that can be used.  this will ignore the global retention if the license does not allow retention updates.
reschedule the cleaner if the service is not stopped.
combines an msearch with rollup + live aggregations into a searchresponse representing the union of the two responses. the response format is identical to a non-rollup search response (aka a "normal aggregation" response). if the msearch response returns the following:  [ "took":228, "timed_out":false, "_shards":..., "hits":..., "aggregations": "histo": "buckets":[ "key_as_string":"2017-05-15t00:00:00.000z", "key":1494806400000, "doc_count":1, "the_max": "value":1.0 ] , "took":205, "timed_out":false, "_shards":..., "hits":..., "aggregations": "filter_histo": "doc_count":1, "histo": "buckets":[ "key_as_string":"2017-05-14t00:00:00.000z", "key":1494720000000, "doc_count":1, "the_max": "value":19995.0 , "histo._count": "value":1.0e9 ]  it would be collapsed into:  "took": 228, "timed_out": false, "_shards": ..., "hits": ..., "aggregations": "histo": "buckets": [ "key_as_string": "2017-05-14t00:00:00.000z", "key": 1494720000000, "doc_count": 1000000000, "the_max": "value": 19995 , "key_as_string": "2017-05-15t00:00:00.000z", "key": 1494806400000, "doc_count": 1, "the_max": "value": 1 ]  it essentially takes the conventions listed in rolluprequesttranslator and processes them so that the final product looks like a regular aggregation response, allowing it to be reducedmerged into the response from the un-rolled index
helper method which unrolls a generic multibucket agg. prefer to use the other overload as a consumer of the api
unrolls multibucket aggregations (e.g. terms, histograms, etc). this overload signature should be called by other internal methods in this class, rather than directly calling the per-type methods.
verifies a live-only search response. essentially just checks for failure then returns the response since we have no work to do
takes an aggregation with rollup conventions and unrolls into a "normal" agg tree
translates a rollup-only search response back into the expected convention. similar to has to deal with the rollup response (no live response) see #combineresponses(multisearchresponse.item[], internalaggregation.reducecontext) for more details on the translation conventions
takes an aggregation with rollup conventions and unrolls into a "normal" agg tree
generic method to help iterate over sub-aggregation buckets and recursively unroll
translates leaf aggs (minmaxsumetc) into their rollup version. for simple aggs like `min`, this is nearly a 1:1 copy. the source is deserialized into a new object, and the field is adjusted according to convention. e.g. for a `min` agg:  "the_min": "min" : "field" : "some_field"  the translation would be:  "the_min": "min" : "field" : "some_field.min.value"  however, for `avg` metrics (and potentially others in the future), the agg is translated into a sum + sum aggs; one for count and one for sum. when unrolling these will be combined back into a single avg. note that we also have to rename the avg agg name to distinguish it from empty buckets. e.g. for an `avg` agg:  "the_avg": "avg" : "field" : "some_field"  the translation would be:  [ "the_avg.value": "sum" : "field" : "some_field.avg.value" , "the_avg._count": "sum" : "field" : "some_field.avg._count" ]  the conventions are:  agg type: same as source agg named: same as the source agg field: `agg_type.field_name.value`  if the agg is an avgagg, the following additional conventions are added:  agg type: becomes sumagg, instead of avgagg named: source name.value additionally, an extra sumagg is added:   named: `source name._count` field: `field name.agg type._count`    most of the leafs to easily clone them
the generic method that does most of the actual heavy-lifting when translating a multi-bucket valuesourcebuilder. this method is called by all the agg-specific methods (e.g. translatedatehistogram()) for this particular agg but is passed downwards for leaf usage a date_histogram, the factory will take return a new datehistogramaggbuilder with matching parameters. it is not a deep clone however; the returned object won't have children set.
translates a non-rollup aggregation tree into a rollup-enabled agg tree. for example, the source aggregation may look like this:  post foo_rollup_search "aggregations": "the_histo": "date_histogram" : "field" : "ts", "interval" : "1d" , "aggs": "the_max": "max": "field": "foo"  which is then translated into an aggregation looking like this:  post rolled_foo_search "aggregations" : "filter_histo" : "filter" : "bool" : "must" : [ "term" : "_rollup.version" : 1 , "term": "ts.date_histogram.interval" : "1d" ] , "aggregations" : "the_histo" : "date_histogram" : "field" : "ts.date_histogram.timestamp", "interval" : "1d" , "aggregations" : "the_histo._count" : "sum" : "field" : "ts.date_histogram._count" , "the_max" : "max" : "field" : "foo.max.value"  the various conventions that are applied during the translation are elucidated in the comments of the relevant method below. require. deserialize into a stream for cloning of a single aggbuilder, since some aggregations (e.g. avg) may result in two translated aggs (sum + count)
translate a normal date_histogram into one that follows the rollup conventions. notably, it adds a sum metric to calculate the doc_count in each bucket. e.g. this date_histogram:  post foo_rollup_search "aggregations": "the_histo": "date_histogram" : "field" : "ts", "interval" : "day"  is translated into:  post rolled_foo_search "aggregations" : "the_histo" : "date_histogram" : "field" : "ts.date_histogram.timestamp", "interval" : "day" , "aggregations" : "the_histo._count" : "sum" : "field" : "ts.date_histogram._count"  the conventions are:  named: same as the source histogram field: `timestamp field.date_histogram.timestamp` add a sumaggregation to each bucket:   named: `parent histogram name._count` field: `timestamp field.date_histogram._count`   add a filter condition:   query type: termquery field: `timestamp_field.date_histogram.interval` value: `source interval`   
translate a normal histogram into one that follows the rollup conventions. notably, it adds a sum metric to calculate the doc_count in each bucket. conventions are identical to a date_histogram (excepting date-specific details), so see a complete list of conventions, examples, etc
translate a normal terms agg into one that follows the rollup conventions. notably, it adds metadata to the terms, and a sum metric to calculate the doc_count in each bucket. e.g. this terms agg:  post foo_rollup_search "aggregations": "the_terms": "terms" : "field" : "foo"  is translated into:  post rolled_foo_search "aggregations" : "the_terms" : "terms" : "field" : "foo.terms.value" , "aggregations" : "the_terms._count" : "sum" : "field" : "foo.terms._count"  the conventions are:  named: same as the source terms agg field: `field name.terms.value` add a sumaggregation to each bucket:   named: `parent terms name._count` field: `field name.terms._count`   
find the set of date_histo's with the largest granularity interval
find the set of histo's with the largest interval
ensure that the metrics are supported by one or more job caps. there is no notion of "best" caps for metrics, it is either supported or not.
ensure that the terms aggregation is supported by one or more job caps. there is no notion of "best" caps for terms, it is either supported or not.
given the aggregation tree and a list of available job capabilities, this method will return a set of the "best" jobs that should be searched. it does this by recursively descending through the aggregation tree and independently pruning the list of valid job caps in each branch. when a leaf node is reached in the branch, the remaining jobs are sorted by "best'ness" (see #getcomparator() for the implementation) and added to a global set of "best jobs". once all branches have been evaluated, the final set is returned to the calling code. job "best'ness" is, briefly, the job(s) that have - the larger compatible date interval - fewer and larger interval histograms - fewer terms groups note: the final set of "best" jobs is not guaranteed to be minimal, there may be redundant effort due to independent branches choosing jobs that are subsets of other branches.
lifted from estestcase :s don't reuse this anywhere! create a copy of an original searchsourcebuilder object by running it through a bytesstreamoutput and reading it in again using a writeable.reader. the stream that is wrapped around the streaminput potentially need to use a namedwriteableregistry, so this needs to be provided too
check to see if the persistenttask's cluster state contains the rollup job(s) we are interested in
helper method used by startstop transportactions so that we can ensure only one task is invoked, or none at all. should not end up in a situation where there are multiple tasks with the same id... but if we do, this will help prevent the situation from getting worse.
the only entry point in this class. you hand this method an aggregation and an index pattern, and it returns a list of rolled documents that you can index
this is called when the persistent task signals that the allocated task should be terminated. termination in the task framework is essentially voluntary, as the allocated task can only be shut down from the inside.
attempt to gracefully cleanup the rollup job so it can be terminated. this tries to remove the job from the scheduler, and potentially any other cleanup operations in the future
this is called by the scheduleengine when the cron triggers.
attempt to stop the indexer if it is idle or actively indexing. if the indexer is aborted this will fail with an exception. note that stopping the job is not immediate. it updates the persistent task's status, but then the allocated task has to notice and stop itself (which may take some time, depending on where in the indexing cycle it is). this method will, however, return as soon as the persistent task has acknowledge the status update.
attempt to start the indexer. if the state is anything other than stopped, this will fail. otherwise, the persistent task's status will be updated to reflect the change. note that while the job is started, the indexer will not necessarily run immediately. that will only occur when the scheduler triggers it based on the cron

wildcards in the request are treated as does the user have ___ privilege on every possible index that matches this pattern? or, expressed differently, does the user have ___ privilege on a wildcard that covers (is a superset of) this pattern?
this tests that the action responds correctly when the userrole has some, but not all of the privileges being checked.
this tests that the action responds correctly when the userrole has none of the privileges being checked.

tests that all the request types that are known to support remote indices successfully pass them through the resolver
verifies that the behaviour tested in #testuserwithnorolescanperformremotesearch does not work for requests that are not remote-index-capable.
this test mimics #testuserwithnorolescanperformremotesearch() except that while the referenced index _looks_ like a remote index, the remote cluster name has not been defined, so it is actually a local index and access should be denied
this test mimics #testuserwithnorolescannotperformlocalsearch() but includes both local and remote indices, including wildcards
adds the authentication to the scrollcontext
compares the authentication that was stored in the scrollcontext with the current authentication. we cannot guarantee that all of the details of the authentication will be the same. some things that could differ include the roles, the name of the authenticating (or lookup) realm. to work around this we compare the username and the originating realm type.
checks for the scrollcontext if it exists and compares the authentication object from the scroll context with the current authentication context
this method is used to determine if a request should be executed as the system user, even if the request already has a user associated with it. in order for the user to be replaced by the system user one of the following conditions must be true:  the action is an internal action and no user is associated with the request the action is an internal action and the thread context contains a non-internal action as the originating action 
stashes the current context and executes the consumer as the proper user based on the origin of the action. this method knows nothing about listeners so it is important that callers ensure their listeners preserve their context and restore it appropriately.
returns true if the thread context contains the origin of the action and does not have any authentication
verifies that the given user can execute the given request (and action). if the user doesn't have the appropriate privileges for this actionrequest, an elasticsearchsecurityexception will be thrown.
performs authorization checks on the items within a bulkshardrequest. this inspects the bulkitemrequest items within the request, computes an implied action for each item's docwriterequest#optype(), and then checks whether that action is allowed on the targeted index. items that fail this checks are bulkitemrequest#abort(string, exception) aborted, with an denied exception. because a shard level request is for exactly 1 index, and there are a small number of possible item docwriterequest.optype types, the number of distinct authorization checks that need to be performed is very small, but the results must be cached, to avoid adding a high overhead to each bulk request.
special handling of the value to authorize for a put mapping request. dynamic put mapping requests use a concrete index, but we allow permissions to be defined on aliases so if the request's concrete index is not in the list of authorized indices, then we need to look to see if this can be authorized against an alias
resolves, and if necessary updates, the list of index names in the provided request in accordance with the user's authorizedindices.  wildcards are expanded at this phase to ensure that all security and execution decisions are made against a fixed set of index names that is consistent and does not change during the life of the request.   if the provided request is of a type that #allowsremoteindices(indicesrequest) allows remote indices, then the index names will be categorized into those that refer to resolvedindices#getlocal() local indices, and those that refer to resolvedindices#getremote() remote indices. this categorization follows the standard  thus an index name n will considered to be remote if-and-only-if all of the following are true  request supports remote indices  n is in the format cluster:index. it is allowable for cluster and index to contain wildcards, but the separator (:) must be explicit.  cluster matches one or more remote cluster names that are registered within this cluster.  in which case, any wildcards in the cluster portion of the name will be expanded and the resulting remote-index-name(s) will be added to the remote index list.  otherwise, n will be added to the local index list.
this test is a direct result of a issue where field level security permissions were not being merged correctly. the improper merging resulted in an allow all result when merging permissions from different roles instead of properly creating a union of their languages
this test is mainly to make sure we can read the default roles.yml config
retrieve a list of roles, if rolestoget is null or empty, fetch all roles
returns true if its safe to use the query cache for this query.
populates fields with the set of fields used by the query, or throws unsupportedoperationexception if it doesn't know how to do this.
adds the index alias .security to the underlying concrete index.
it is a requirement that empty string filters match empty string fields. in this case we require automatons from empty string to match the empty string. `automatons.predicate("").test("") == false` `automatons.predicate("").test("") == true`
if a field is missing for an event, its value for filtering purposes is the empty string or a singleton stream of the empty string. this a allows a policy to filter by the missing value using the empty string, ie `ignore_filters.users: ["", "elastic"]` will filter events with a missing user field (such as `anonymous_access_denied`) as well as events from the "elastic" username.
starts the service. the state is moved to org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.audit.index.indexaudittrail.state#starting at the beginning of the method. the service's components are initialized and if the current node is the master, the index template will be stored. the state is moved org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.audit.index.indexaudittrail.state#started and before returning the queue of messages that came before the service started is drained.
atomically writes to the specified file a line per entry in the specified map using the specified transform to convert each entry to a line. the writing is done atomically in the following sense: first the lines are written to a temporary file and if the writing succeeds then the temporary file is moved to the specified path, replacing the file if it exists. if a failure occurs, any existing file is preserved, and the temporary file is cleaned up.
prepares the index by creating it if it doesn't exist or updating the mappings if the mappings are out of date. after any tasks have been executed, the runnable is then executed.
returns the routing-table for this index, or null if the index does not exist.
resolves a concrete index name or alias to a indexmetadata instance. requires that if supplied with an alias, the alias resolves to at most one concrete index.
check if attributes of the paths have changed, warning to the given terminal if they have.
create a checker for the given paths, which will warn to the given terminal if changes are made.
extracts the rest remote address from the message context. if not found, returns null. transport messages that were created by rest handlers, should have this in their context.
check whether the given request is allowed within the current license state and setup, and return the name of any unlicensed feature. by default this returns an exception if security is not available by the current license or security is not enabled. sub-classes can override this method if they have additional requirements. sent to the requestor
calls the #innerpreparerequest(restrequest, nodeclient) method and then checks the license state. if the license state allows auth, the result from response will be returned indicating that security is not licensed. note: the implementing rest handler is called before the license is checked so that we do not trip the unused parameters check
refreshes the current in-use metadata.
creates an elasticsearchsecurityexception that indicates the token was expired. it is up to the client to re-authenticate and obtain a new token. the format for this response is defined in  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6750#section-3.1">
create a token based on the provided authentication and metadata. the created token will be stored in the security index.
creates an elasticsearchsecurityexception that indicates the request contained an invalid grant
this method performs the steps necessary to invalidate a token so that it may no longer be used.
rotate the current active key to the spare key created in the previous #generatesparekey() call.
this method performs the steps necessary to invalidate a token so that it may no longer be used. the process of invalidation involves a step that is needed for backwards compatibility with versions prior to 6.2.0; this step records an entry to indicate that a token with a given id has been expired. the second step is to record the invalidation for tokens that have been created on versions on or after 6.2; this step involves performing an update to the token document and setting the invalidated field to true
checks if the token has been stored as a revoked token to ensure we do not allow tokens that have been explicitly cleared.
uses the refresh token to refresh its associated token and returns the new token with an updated expiration date to the listener
performs checks on the retrieved source and returns an optional with the exception if there is an issue
looks in the context to see if the request provided a header with a user token and if so the token is validated, which includes authenticated decryption and verification that the token has not been revoked or is expired.
gets the token from the authorization header if the header begins with bearer 
performs the actual invalidation of a token
performs the actual bwc invalidation of a token and then kicks off the new invalidation method
find all stored refresh and access tokens that have not been invalidated or expired, and were issued against the specified realm.
creates an elasticsearchsecurityexception that indicates the token was expired. it is up to the client to re-authenticate and obtain a new token. the format for this response is defined in  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6750#section-3.1">
performs the actual refresh of the token with retries in case of certain exceptions that may be recoverable. the refresh involves retrieval of the token document and then updating the token document to indicate that the document has been refreshed.
creates a new token service
creates a new key unless present that is newer than the current active key and returns the corresponding metadata. note: this method doesn't modify the metadata used in this token service. see #refreshmetadata(tokenmetadata)
reads the authentication and metadata from the given token. this method does not validate whether the token is expired or not.
prunes the keys and keeps up to the latest n keys around
generates a secret key based off of the provided password and salt. this method is computationally expensive.
serializes a token to a string containing an encrypted representation of the token
creates a new token based on the values from the stream
iterates over the realms and attempts to lookup the run as user by the given username. the consumer will be called regardless of if the user is found or not, with a non-null user. we do not fail requests if the run as user is not found as that can leak the names of users that exist using a timing attack
consumes the user that resulted from attempting to authenticate a token against the realms. when the user is functionality is in use. when run as is not in use, #finishauthentication(user) is called, otherwise we try to lookup the run as user in #lookuprunasuser(user, string, consumer)
consumes the authenticationtoken provided by the caller. in the case of a null token, #handlenulltoken() is called. in the case of a non-null token, the realms are iterated over and the first realm that returns a non-null if no exception was caught while trying to authenticate the token
finishes the authentication process by ensuring the returned user is enabled and that the run as user is enabled if there is one. if authentication is successful, this method also ensures that the authentication is written to the threadcontext
writes the authentication to the threadcontext and then calls the listener if successful
looks to see if the request contains an existing authentication and if so, that authentication will be used. the consumer is called if no exception was thrown while trying to read the authentication and may be called with a null value
determines whether type is an internal realm-type that is provided by x-pack, including the reservedrealm
creates realm.factory factories for each internal realm type. this excludes the reservedrealm, as it cannot be created dynamically.
finds all values for the specified attribute
constructs a saml specific exception with a consistent message regarding saml signature validation failures
tests whether the provided function returns true for any of the idp's signing credentials.
processes the provided logoutrequest and extracts the nameid and sessionindex. returns these in a samlattributes object with an empty attributes list.  the recommended binding for logout (for maximum interoperability) is http-redirect. under this binding the signature is applied to the query-string (including parameter names and url-encodedbase64-encodeddeflated values). therefore in order to properly validate the signature, this method operates on a raw query- string.
map of saml-attribute name to configuration-setting name
the spec states that this should never happen (saml bindings spec, v2.0 wd6, section 3.4.4.1, point 3). onelogin includes newlines anyway.
creates a saml org.opensaml.saml.saml2.core.logoutresponse to the provided requestid
factory for saml realm. this is not a constructor as it needs to initialise a number of components before delegating to
creates a saml logoutrequest single logout request for the provided session, if the realm and idp configuration support slo. otherwise returns null
this is testing a test, but the real encryption tests are useless if our encryption routines don't do anything
randomly selects digital signature algorithm uri for given private key algorithm ( privatekey#getalgorithm()).
reads a key pair and associated certificate for given algorithm and key length for testing, for "ec" algorithm 256 key size is used, others use 2048 as default.
request a named attribute be provided as part of assertions. specified in a attributeconsumingservice
constructs an entitydescriptor that contains a single spssodescriptor.
tests that a user can login via a saml idp: it uses:  a real idp (shibboleth, running locally) a fake ui, running in this jvm, that roughly mimic kibana (see #httplogin, #httpacs) a fake web browser (apache http client)  it takes the following steps:  requests a "login" on the local ui walks through the login process at the idp receives a json response from the local ui that has a bearer token uses that token to verify the user details 
finds the target url and samlresponse for the html form from the provided content.
this is a simple mapping that maps the "thor" user in the "shibboleth" realm to the "kibana_users" role. we could do something more complex, but we have unit tests for role-mapping - this is just to verify that the mapping runs ok in a real environment.
we perform all requests to elasticsearch as the "kibana" user, as this is the user that will be used in a typical saml deployment (where kibana is providing the ui for the saml web sso interactions). before we can use the kibana user, we need to set its password to something we know.
verifies that the provided "refresh token" (see org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.tokenservice) can be used to get a new valid access token and refresh token.
submits a saml assertion to the acs uri.
submits a shibboleth consent form to the provided uri. the consent form is a step that shibboleth inserts into the login flow to confirm that the user is willing to send their personal details to the application (sp) that they are logging in to.
provides the "login" handler for the fake webapp. this interacts with elasticsearch (using the rest client) to find the login page for the idp, and then sends a redirect to that page.
provides the "assertion-consumer-service" handler for the fake webapp. this interacts with elasticsearch (using the rest client) to perform a saml login, and just forwards the json response back to the client.
navigates to the login page on the local (in memory) http ui.
wraps a httphandler in a try-catch block that returns a 500 server error if an exception or an assertionerror occurs.
verifies that the provided "access token" (see org.elasticsearch.xpack.security.authc.tokenservice) is for the expected user with the expected name and roles.
submits a shibboleth login form to the provided uri.
processes the provided saml response within the provided token and, if valid, extracts the relevant attributes from it.
constructs an exception that can be distinguished (via #issamlexception as a saml specific exception used to distinguish "expected" exceptions (such as saml signature failures, or missing attributes) that should be treated as a simple authentication failure (with a clear cause)
enabling schema validation with `setvalidating(true)` in our documentbuilderfactory requires that we provide our own errorhandler implementation
this is needed in order to initialize the underlying opensaml library. it must be called before doing anything that potentially interacts with opensaml (whether in server code, or in tests). the initialization happens within do privileged block as the underlying apache xml security library has a permission check. the initialization happens with a specific context classloader as opensaml loads resources from its jar file.
constructs a documentbuilder with all the necessary features for it to be secure
enabling a user forces a doc to be written to the security index, and "user doc with empty password" has a special case code in the reserved realm.
asynchronous method to put a user. a put user request without a password hash is treated as an update and will fail with a upsert document as well; the upsert document sets the enabled flag of the user to true but if the document already exists, this method will not modify the enabled value.
retrieve a list of users, if usernames is null or empty, fetch all users
async method to change the password of a native or reserved user. if a reserved user does not exist, the document will be created with a hash of the provided password.
async method to retrieve a user and their password
handles updating a user that should already exist where their password should not change
asynchronous method to create a reserved user with the given password hash. the cache for the user will be cleared after the document has been indexed
tests that multiple concurrent run as requests can be authenticated successfully. there was a bug in the cache implementation used for our internal realms that caused some run as requests to fail even when the authentication was valid and the run as user existed. the issue was that when iterating the realms there would be failed lookups and under heavy concurrency, requests will wait for an existing load attempt in the cache. the original caller was thrown an executionexception with a nested nullpointerexception since the loader returned a null value, while the other caller(s) would get a null value unexpectedly
creates a new logger that is detached from the root logger and only has an appender that will output log messages to the terminal
general purpose http(s) call with json content-type and authorization header. ssl settings are read from the settings file, if any. user in the authorization header. password in the authorization header. supplier for the json string body of the request. handler of the response input stream.
collects passwords for all the users, then issues set requests. fails on the first failed request. in this case rerun the tool to redo all the operations.
validates the bootstrap password from the local keystore by making an '_authenticate' call. returns silently if server is reachable and password is valid. throws userexception otherwise.
sets one user's password using the elastic superuser credentials.
parses the users file. returns null, if the users file does not exist.
internally in this class, we try to load the file, but if for some reason we can't, we're being more lenient by logging the error and skipping all users. this is aligned with how we handle other auto-loaded files in security.

accepts a mapping of user -> list of roles
parses the users_roles file. returns null if the users_roles file does not exist. the read file holds a mapping per line of the form "role -> users" while the returned map holds entries of the form "user -> roles".
checks the user exists with the given password
checks the role has the given users, or that the role does not exist if not users are passed.
checks the user does not exist in the users or users_roles files
tests searching for groups when the "user_attribute" field is set to "dn" (which is special)
tests that a client-side timeout in the asynchronous ldap sdk is treated as a failure, rather than simply returning no results.
tests searching for groups when the "user_attribute" field is set to a missing value
tests searching for groups when the "user_attribute" field is not set
creates a realm with the provided settings, rebuilds the ssl service to be aware of the new realm, and then returns the realmconfig
wraps the provided sessionlistener to preserve the threadcontext associated with the current thread. responses headers are not preserved, as they are not needed. response output should not yet exist, nor should any be produced within the realmldap-session.
given a username and password, open a connection to ldap, bind to authenticate, retrieve groups, map to roles and build the user. this user will then be passed to the listener
if the execution of this runnable has not already started, the runnable is cancelled and we pass an exception to the user listener
sets up a ldapsession using the connection pool that potentially holds existing connections to the server
sets up a ldapsession using the following process:  opening a new connection to the ldap server executes a bind request using the bind user executes a search to find the dn of the user closes the opened connection opens a new connection to the ldap server executes a bind request using the found dn and provided password creates a new ldapsession with the bound connection 
the contract for realm implementations is that they should log-and-return-null (and not call actionlistener#onfailure(exception)) if there is an internal exception that prevented them from performing an authentication. this method tests that when an ldap server is unavailable (invalid hostname), there is a null result rather than an exception.
securely escapes the username and inserts it into the template using messageformat
this iterates through the configured user templates attempting to open. if all attempts fail, the last exception is kept as the cause of the thrown exception
creates the connection pool that will be used by the session factory and initializes the health check support
this method is used to cleanup the connection pool if one is being used
this method performs an asynchronous ldap search operation that could have multiple results
this method performs an asynchronous ldap search operation that only expects at most one result. if more than one result is found then this is an error if no results are found, then null will be returned. if the ldap server returns an error resultcode then this is handled as a

this method performs an asynchronous ldap search operation that could have multiple results
if necessary, fork before executing the runnable. a deadlock will happen if the same thread which handles bind responses blocks on the bind call, waiting for the response which he itself should handle.
this method performs an asynchronous ldap search operation that could have multiple results
this method submits the bind request over one connection from the pool. the bind authentication is then reverted and the connection is returned to the pool, so that the connection can be safely reused, see bind credentials. bind calls are blocking and if a bind is executed on the ldap connection reader thread (as returned by ldaputils#isldapconnectionthread), the thread will be blocked until it is interrupted by something else such as a timeout timer. do not call bind outside this method or the ldap connection pool on which to submit the bind operation. the request object of the bind operation. the threads that will call the blocking bind operation, in case the calling thread is a connection reader, see: the runnable that continues the program flow after the bind operation. it is executed on the same thread as the prior bind.

flush the running job, ensuring that the native process has had the opportunity to process all data previously sent to it with none left sitting in buffers. (e.g. calculating interim results, time control, etc.)
request temporary storage to be used for the job
do a forecast for the running job.
stop the running job and mark it as finished.
passes data to the native process. this is a blocking call that won't return until all the data has been written to the process.  an elasticsearchstatusexception will be thrown is any of these error conditions occur:  if a configured field is missing from the csv header if json data is malformed and we cannot recover parsing if a high proportion of the records the timestamp field that cannot be parsed if a high proportion of the records chronologically out of order 
care must be taken to ensure this method is not called while data is being posted. the methods in this class that call it wait for all processing to complete first. the expectation is that external calls are only made when cleaning up after a fatal error.

lower level functions to write record fields individually.
lower level functions to write records individually. after this function is called #writefield(string) must be called numfields times.
read the json object and write to the record array. nested objects are flattened with the field names separated by a '.'. e.g. for a record with a nested 'tags' object: ""name":"my.test.metric1","tags":"tag1":"blah","tag2":"boo", "time":1350824400,"value":12345.678" use 'tags.tag1' to reference the tag1 field in the nested object  array fields in the json are ignored read fields are written to this array. this array is first filled with empty strings and will never contain a null boolean array each element is true if that field was read because the end of the stream was reached
in some cases the parser doesn't recognise the '' of a badly formed json document and so may skip to the end of the second document. in this case we lose an extra record.
returns null at the eof or the next token
get the text representation of the current token unless it's a null. nulls are replaced with empty strings to match the way the rest of the product treats them (which in turn is shaped by the fact that csv cannot distinguish empty string and null).
there's a problem with the parser where in this case it skips over the first 2 records instead of to the end of the first record which is invalid json. this means we miss the next record after a bad one.

test the writefield and writenumfields methods of lengthencodedwriter
write the ml autodetect field options to the outputindex stream.
send a flush message to the c++ autodetect process. this actually consists of two messages: one to carry the flush id and the other (which might not be processed until much later) to fill the buffers and force prior messages through. autodetect process once it is complete.
transform the supplied control message to length encoded values and write to the outputstream. the number of blank fields to make up a full record is deduced from analysisconfig.
writes the control messages that are requested when flushing a job. those control messages need to be followed by a flush message in order for them to reach the c++ process immediately. list of supported controls:  advance time calculate interim results  (e.g. calculating interim results, time control, etc.)
create indexes of the output fields. this is the time field and all the fields configured for analysis and the control field. time is the first field and the last is the control field
transform the date in the input data and write all fields to the length encoded writer.  fields must be copied from input to output before this function is called. this should be the same size as the number of output (analysis fields) i.e. the size of the map returned by #outputfieldindexes()
accessible for testing only.
set up the field index mappings. this must be called before  finds the required input indexes in the header and sets the mappings to the corresponding output indexes.

constructs a datatoprocesswriter depending on the data format and the time transformation. otherwise a csvdatatoprocesswriter
test parsing csv with the nul character code point (\0 or \u0000)
this test is designed to pick up n-squared processing in the state consumption code. the size of the state document is comparable to those that the c++ code will create for a huge model. 10 seconds is an overestimate of the time required to avoid spurious failures due to vm stalls - on a reasonable spec laptop this should take around 1 second.
splits bulk data streamed from the c++ process on '\0' characters. the data is expected to be a series of elasticsearch bulk requests in utf-8 json (as would be uploaded to the public rest api) separated by zero bytes ('\0').
ensure that we do not accept nan values
the purpose of this method is to avoid saturating the cluster state update thread when a lookback job is churning through buckets very fast and the memory usage of the job is changing regularly. the idea is to only update the established model memory associated with the job a few seconds after the new value has been received. if more updates are received during the delay period then they simply replace the value that originally caused the update to be scheduled. this rate limits cluster state updates due to established model memory changing to one per job per delay period. (in reality updates will only occur this rapidly during lookback. during real-time operation the limit of one model size stats document per bucket will mean there is a maximum of one cluster state update per job per bucket, and usually the bucket span is 5 minutes or more.)
this method is called from two places: - from the future used for delayed updates - when shutting down this result processor when shutting down the result processor it's only necessary to do anything if an update has been scheduled, but we want to do the update immediately. despite cancelling the scheduled update in this case, it's possible that it's already started running, in which case this method will get called twice in quick succession. but the second call will do nothing, as scheduledestablishedmodelmemoryupdate will have been reset to null by the first call.
given a model snapshot, get the corresponding state and write it to the supplied stream. if there are multiple state documents they are separated using '\0' when written to the stream. because we have a rule that we will not open a legacy job in the current product version we don't have to worry about legacy document ids here.

get the "established" memory usage of a job, if it has one. in order for a job to be considered to have established memory usage it must: - have generated at least buckets_for_established_memory_size buckets of results - have generated at least one model size stats document - have low variability of model bytes in model size stats documents in the time period covered by the last buckets_for_established_memory_size buckets, which is defined as having a coefficient of variation of no more than established_memory_cv_threshold null, implying the latest bucket that exists in the results index these when available avoids one search specified job, or 0 if memory usage is not yet established
get a page of categorydefinitions for the given jobid. uses a supplied client, so may run as the currently authenticated user
check that a previously deleted job with the same id has not left any result or categorizer state documents due to a failed delete. any left over results would appear to be part of the new job. we can't check for model state as the id is based on the snapshot id which is a timestamp and so unpredictable however, it is unlikely a new job would have the same snapshot id as an old one.
update the job's data counts stats and figures.
execute the bulk action
the first time next() is called, the search will be performed and the first batch will be returned. any subsequent call will return the following batches.  note that in some implementations it is possible that when there are no results at all, the first time this method is called an empty deque is returned.

given a field value, convert it to a list of tokens using the configured analyzer.
verify that the config builder will build a valid config. this is not done as part of the basic build because it verifies that the names of analyzerstokenizersfilters referenced by the config are known, and the validity of these names could change over time. additionally, it has to be done server-side rather than client-side, as the client will not have loaded the appropriate analysis modulesplugins.

processes a list of aggregations and writes a flat json document for each of its leaf aggregations. supported sub-aggregations include:   multibucketsaggregation  numericmetricsaggregation.singlevalue  percentiles 
constructs a processor that processes aggregations into json
write the aggregated documents one bucket at a time until batchsize key-value pairs have been written. buckets are written in their entirety and the check on batchsize run after the bucket has been written so more than batchsize key-value pairs could be written. the function should be called repeatedly until it returns false, at that point there are no more documents to write. false if there are no documents to write.
adds a leaf key-value. it returns the name of the key added or null when nothing was added. non-finite metric values are not added.
this format matches if the sample consists of one or more xml documents, all with the same root element name. if there is more than one document, only whitespace is allowed in between them. the last one does not necessarily have to be complete (as the sample could have truncated it).
given a collection of strings, and a grok pattern that matches some part of them all, return collections of the bits that come before (prefaces) and after (epilogues) the bit that matches.

this must only be called if #matchesall returns true.
build a grok pattern that will match all of the sample messages in their entirety.
this method attempts to find a grok pattern that will match all of the sample messages in their entirety.
this format matches if the sample consists of one or more json documents. if there is more than one, they must be newline-delimited. the documents must be non-empty, to prevent lines containing "" from matching.
given some sample values for a field, guess the most appropriate index mapping for the field. may be non-empty when the method is called, and this method may append to it. mapping will be compatible with all the provided values. must not be empty. for example  "type" : "keyword" .
given one or more sample records, find a timestamp field that is consistently present in them all. to be returned the timestamp field: - must exist in every record - must have the same timestamp format in every record if multiple fields meet these criteria then the one that occurred first in the first sample record is chosen. may be non-empty when the method is called, and this method may append to it. there is no consistent timestamp.
given the sampled records, guess appropriate elasticsearch mappings.
this method implements the simple algorithm for calculating levenshtein distance.
sum of the levenshtein distances between corresponding elements in the two supplied lists _excluding_ the biggest difference. the reason the biggest difference is excluded is that sometimes there's a "message" field that is much longer than any of the other fields, varies enormously between rows, and skews the comparison.
sometimes elasticsearch mappings for dates need to include the format. this method returns appropriate mappings settings: at minimum "type"="date", and possibly also a "format" setting.
find the first timestamp format that matches part of the supplied value, excluding a specified number of candidate formats.
interpret the fractional seconds component of a date to determine two things: 1. the separator character - one of colon, comma and dot. 2. the number of digits in the fractional component.
find the best timestamp format for matching an entire field value, excluding a specified number of candidate formats.
this format matches if the sample contains at least one newline and at least two non-blank lines.
this has to use different logic to the input pipe case to avoid the danger of creating a regular file when the named pipe does not exist when the method is first called.
the default path where named pipes will be created. on nix they can be created elsewhere (subject to security manager constraints), but on windows this is the only place they can be created.
open a named pipe created elsewhere for input.
the logic here is very similar to that of opening an input stream, because on windows java cannot create a regular file when asked to open a named pipe that doesn't exist.

test the analysisconfig#analysisfields() method which produces a list of analysis fields from the detectors
create the elasticsearch mapping for state. state could potentially be huge (target document size is 16mb and there can be many documents) so all analysis by elasticsearch is disabled. the only way to retrieve state is by knowing the id of a particular document.
anomalyrecord fields to be added under the 'properties' section of the mapping
create the elasticsearch mapping for modelsnapshot. the '_all' field is disabled but the type is searchable
the type is disabled so datacounts aren't searchable and the '_all' field is disabled
create the elasticsearch mapping for categorydefinition. the '_all' field is disabled as the document isn't meant to be searched.
creates a default mapping which has a dynamic template that treats all dynamically added fields as keywords. this is needed so that the per-job term fields will not be automatically added as fields of type 'text' to the index mappings of newly rolled indices.
inserts "_meta" containing useful information like the version into the mapping template.
create the elasticsearch mapping for results objects the mapping has a custom all field containing the _field_value fields e.g. by_field_value, over_field_value, etc. the custom all field #all_field_values must be set in the index settings. a custom all field is preferred over the usual '_all' field as most fields do not belong in '_all', disabling '_all' and using a custom all field simplifies the mapping. these fields are copied to the custom all field  by_field_value partition_field_value over_field_value anomalycause.correlated_by_field_value anomalycause.by_field_value anomalycause.partition_field_value anomalycause.over_field_value anomalyrecord.influencers.influencer_field_values influencer.influencer_field_value

creates an error message that explains there are shard failures, displays info for the first failure (shardreason) and kindly asks to see more info in the logs
creates a formatter according to the given pattern see datetimeformatter for the syntax of the accepted patterns (e.g. contains a date but not a time)
check the given timevalue is a multiple of the baseunit
first tries to parse the date first as a long and convert that to an epoch time. if the long number has more than 10 digits it is considered a time in milliseconds else if 10 or less digits it is in seconds. if that fails it tries to parse the string using if the date string cannot be parsed -1 is returned. parsed.
convert the scheduled event to a detection rule. the rule will have 2 time based conditions for the start and end of the event. the rule's start and end times are aligned with the bucket span so the start time is rounded down to a bucket interval and the end time rounded up.

shuts down the trigger service as well to make sure there are no lingering threads also no need to check anything, as this is final, we just can go to status stopped
reload watches and start scheduling them
ensure that watcher can be reloaded, by checking if all indices are marked as up and ready in the cluster state
wraps an abstract runnable to easier supply onfailure and dorun methods via lambdas this ensures that the uncaught exception handler in the executing threadpool does not get called
start the watcher service, load watches in the background
this reads all watches from the .watches indexalias and puts them into memory for a short period of time, before they are fed into the trigger service.
stops the watcher service and marks its services as paused
reload the watcher service, does not switch the state from stopped to started, just keep going
stop execution of watches on this node, do not try to reload anything, but still allow manual watch execution, i.e. via the execute watch api
reloads all the reloadable services in watcher.
stop certain parts of watcher, when there are no watcher indices on this node by checking the shardrouting note that this is not easily possible, because of the execute watch api, that needs to be able to execute anywhere! this means, only certain components can be stopped
if the index operation happened on a watcher shard and is of doc type watcher, we will remove the watch id from the trigger service
check if the routing table has changed and local shards are affected
this returns a mapping of the shard it to the index of the shard allocation ids in that list. the idea here is to have a basis for consistent hashing in order to decide if a watch needs to be triggered locally or on another system, when it is being indexed as a single watch action. example: - shardid(".watch", 0) - all allocation ids sorted (in the cluster): [ "a", "b", "c", "d"] - local allocation id: b (index position 1) - then store the size of the allocation ids and the index position data.put(shardid(".watch", 0), new tuple(1, 4))
listen for cluster state changes. this method will start, stop or reload the watcher service based on cluster state information. the method checks, if there are local watch indices up and running.
single watch operations that check if the local trigger service should trigger for this concrete watch watch parsing could be optimized, so that parsing only happens on primary and where the shard is supposed to be put into the trigger service at some point, right no we dont care note, we have to parse on the primary, because otherwise a failure on the replica when parsing the watch would result in failing the replica
in case of an error, we have to ensure that the triggerservice does not leave anything behind todo: if the configuration changes between preindex and postindex methods and we add a watch, that could not be indexed todo: this watch might not be deleted from the triggerservice. are we willing to accept this? todo: this could be circumvented by using a threadlocal in preindex(), that contains the watch and is cleared afterwards
reload the configuration if the alias pointing to the watch index was changed or the index routing table for an index was changed
create a mock cluster state, the returns the specified index as watch index
resolve the failure reason, when a reason can be extracted from the response body: ex: "errormessages":[],"errors":"customfield_10004":"epic name is required."  see https:docs.atlassian.comjirarestcloud for the format of the error response body.

renders the attachment in slack compatible structure:  https:api.slack.comdocsattachments#attachment_structure
finds a setting, and then a secure setting if the setting is null, or returns null if one does not exist. this differs from other getsetting calls in that it allows for null whereas the other methods throw an exception. note: if your setting was not previously secure, than the string reference that is in the setting object is still insecure. this is only constructing a new securestring with the char[] of the insecure setting.
loads the standard java mail properties as settings from the given account settings. the standard settings are not that readable, therefore we enabled the user to configure those in a readable way... this method first loads the smtp settings (which corresponds to all java mail mail.smtp. settings), and then replaces the readable keys to the official "unreadable" keys. we'll then use these settings when crea

reads the contents of parser to create the correct input
empty the currently queued tasks and wait for current executions to finish.
execute triggered watches, which have been successfully indexed into the triggered watches index
updates and persists the status of the given watch if the watch is missing (because it might have been deleted by the user during an execution), then this method does nothing and just returns without throwing an exception
this clears out the current executions and sets new empty current executions this is needed, because when this method is called, watcher keeps running, so sealing executions would be a bad idea
create a tuple of triggered watches and their corresponding contexts, usable for sync and async processing
gets a watch but in a synchronous way, so that no async calls need to be built
calling this method makes the class stop accepting new executions and throws and exception instead. in addition it waits for a certain amount of time for current executions to finish before returning
tries to put an watch execution class for a watch in the current executions
create a bulk request from the triggered watches with a specified document type
checks if any of the loaded watches has been put into the triggered watches index for immediate execution note: this is executing a blocking call over the network, thus a potential source of problems
creates a http proxy from the system wide settings
enriches the config object optionally with proxy information
returns all the headers, with keys being lowercased, so they are always consistent in the payload
write a request via toxcontent, but filter certain parts of it - this is needed to not expose secrets
in order to test, that .watches and .triggered-watches indices can also point to an alias, we will rarely create those after starting watcher the idea behind this is the possible use of the migration helper for upgrades, see https:github.comelasticelasticsearch-migration

check if everything is set up for the history store to operate fully. checks for the current watcher history index and if it is open.
stores the specified watchrecord. if the specified watchrecord already was stored this call will fail with a version conflict.
this test makes sure that when an action encounters an error it should not be subject to throttling. also, the ack status of the action in the watch should remain awaits_successful_execution as long as the execution fails.

method to get indexmetadata of a index, that potentially is behind an alias.
iterates through the "properties" field of mappings and returns any predicates that match in the form of issue-strings.
returns status of shards currently finished snapshots  this method is executed on master node and it's complimentary to the returns similar information but for already finished snapshots. 
validates snapshot request
removes a finished snapshot from the cluster state. this can happen if the previous master node processed a cluster state update that marked the snapshot as finished, but the previous master node died before removing the snapshot in progress from the cluster state. it is then the responsibility of the new master node to end the snapshot and remove it from the cluster state.
initializes the snapshotting process.  this method is used by clients to start snapshot. it makes sure that there is no snapshots are currently running and creates a snapshot record in cluster state metadata.
retrieves snapshot from repository
removes record of running snapshot from cluster state and notifies the listener when this action is complete
deletes snapshot from repository.  if the snapshot is still running cancels the snapshot first and then deletes it from the repository.

returns a list of snapshots from repository sorted by snapshot creation date if false, they will throw an error
cleans up shard snapshots that were running on removed nodes
check if any of the indices to be deleted are currently being snapshotted. fail as deleting an index that is being snapshotted (with partial == false) makes the snapshot fail.
returns status of the currently running snapshots  this method is executed on master node 
starts snapshot.  creates snapshot in repository and updates snapshot metadata record with list of shards that needs to be processed.
removes the snapshot deletion from snapshotdeletionsinprogress in the cluster state.
finalizes a snapshot deletion in progress if the current node is the master but it was not master in the previous cluster state and there is still a lingering snapshot deletion in progress in the cluster state. this means that the old master failed before it could clean up an in-progress snapshot deletion. we attempt to delete the snapshot files and remove the deletion from the cluster state. it is possible that the old master was in a state of long gc and then it resumes and tries to delete the snapshot that has already been deleted by the current master. this is acceptable however, since the old master's snapshot deletion will just respond with an error but in actuality, the snapshot was deleted and a call to get snapshots would reveal that the snapshot no longer exists.
check if any of the indices to be closed are currently being snapshotted. fail as closing an index that is being snapshotted (with partial == false) makes the snapshot fail.
finalizes the shard in repository and then removes it from cluster state  this is non-blocking method that runs on a thread from snapshot thread pool

reads shard failure information from stream input
serializes snapshot failure information into json
constructs new snapshot shard failure object
gets a new snapshotinfo instance for a snapshot that is incompatible with the current version of the cluster.
constructs snapshot information from stream input
this method creates a snapshotinfo from internal x-content. it does not handle x-content written with the external version as external x-content is only for display purposes and does not need to be parsed.
returns snapshot rest status
tests that a snapshot with a corrupted global state file can still be deleted
tests that a snapshot with a corrupted global state file can still be restored
tests that a snapshot of multiple indices including one with a corrupted index metadata file can still be used to restore the non corrupted indices
this test ensures that when a shard is removed from a node (perhaps due to the node leaving the cluster, then returning), all snapshotting of that shard is aborted, so all store references held onto by the snapshot are released. see https:github.comelasticelasticsearchissues20876

returns true iff the given search source builder can be early terminated by rewriting to a match none query. or in other words if the execution of a the search request can be early terminated without executing it. this is for instance not possible if a global aggregation is part of this request or if there is a suggest builder present.
try to load the query results from the cache or execute the query phase directly if the cache cannot be used.
this method does a very quick rewrite of the query and returns true if the query can potentially match any documents. this method can have false positives while if it returns false the query won't match any documents on the current shard.

these models are all minimizable, so they should not throw exceptions
test simple moving average on single value field
if the minimizer is turned on, but there isn't enough data to minimize with, it will simply use the default settings. which means our mock histo will match the generated result (which it won't if the minimizer is actually working, since the coefficients will be different and thus generate different data) we can simulate this by setting the window size == size of histo

internal optimization for ordering internalterms.buckets by a sub aggregation.  in this phase, if the order is based on sub-aggregations, we need to use a different comparator to avoid constructing buckets for ordering purposes (we can potentially have a lot of buckets and building them will cause loads of redundant object constructions). the "special" comparators here will fetch the sub aggregation values directly from the sub aggregators bypassing bucket creation. note that the comparator attached to the order will still be used in the reduce phase of the aggregation.

returns a built (on demand) routing nodes view of the routing table.
tests whether or not the custom should be serialized. the criteria are:  the output stream must be at least the minimum supported version of the custom the output stream must have the feature required by the custom (if any) or not be a transport client   that is, we only serialize customs to clients than can understand the custom based on the version of the client and the features that the client has. for transport clients we can be lenient in requiring a feature in which case we do not send the custom but for connected nodes we always require that the node has the required feature.

retrieves the cluster state for the given indices and then checks that the cluster state returns coherent data for both routing table and metadata.
returns the indices deleted in this event
determines whether or not the current cluster state represents an entirely new cluster, either when a node joins a cluster for the first time or when the node receives a cluster state update from a brand new cluster (different uuid from the previous cluster), which will happen when a master node is elected that has never been part of the cluster before.

makes sure that the indices being waited on before snapshotting commences are populated with all shards in the relocating or initializing state.
creates a new clusterstatehealth instance considering the current cluster state and the provided index names.
checks if an inactive primary shard should cause the cluster health to go red. an inactive primary shard in an index should cause the cluster health to be red to make it visible that some of the existing data is unavailable. in case of index creation, snapshot restore or index shrinking, which are unexceptional events in the cluster lifecycle, cluster health should not turn red for the time where primaries are still in the initializing state but go to yellow instead. however, in case of exceptional events, for example when the primary shard cannot be assigned to a node or initialization fails at some point, cluster health should still turn red. nb: this method should not be called on active shards nor on non-primary shards.
creates a discoverynode representing the local node.
creates a new discoverynode.  note: if the version of the node is unknown version#minimumcompatibilityversion() should be used for the current version. it corresponds to the minimum version this elasticsearch version can communicate with. if a higher version is used the node might not be able to communicate with the remote node. after initial handshakes node versions will be discovered and updated.

relocate a shard to another node, adding the target initializing shard as well as assigning it.
moves the assigned replica shard to primary.
calculates routingnodes statistics by iterating over all shardroutings in the cluster to ensure the book-keeping is correct. for performance reasons, this should only be called from asserts this method does nothing.
returns the active primary shard for the given shard id or null if no primary is found or the primary is not active.
applies the relevant logic to handle a cancelled or failed shard. moves the shard to unassigned or completely removes the shard (if relocation target). - if shard is a primary, this also fails initializing replicas. - if shard is an active primary, this also promotes an active replica to primary (if such a replica exists). - if shard is a relocating primary, this also removes the primary relocation target shard. - if shard is a relocating replica, this promotes the replica relocation target to a full initializing replica, removing the relocation source information. this is possible as peer recovery is always done from the primary. - if shard is a (primary or replica) relocation target, this also clears the relocation information on the source shard.
cancels the give shard from the routing nodes internal statistics and cancels the relocation if the shard is relocating.
creates an iterator over shards interleaving between nodes: the iterator returns the first shard from the first node, then the first shard of the second node, etc. until one shard from each node has been returned. the iterator then resumes on the first node by returning the second shard and continues until all shards from all the nodes have been returned.
returns true iff all replicas are active for the given shard routing. otherwise false
removes and ignores the unassigned shard (will be ignored for this run, but will be added back to unassigned once the metadata is constructed again). typically this is used when an allocation decision prevents a shard from being allocated such that subsequent consumers of this api won't try to allocate this shard again.
cancels a relocation of a shard that shard must relocating.
initializes the current unassigned shard and moves it from the unassigned list.
moves assigned primary to unassigned and demotes it to a replica. used in conjunction with #promoteactivereplicashardtoprimary when an active replica is promoted to primary.
applies the relevant logic to start an initializing shard. moves the initializing shard to started. if the shard is a relocation target, also removes the relocation source. if the started shard is a primary relocation target, this also reinitializes currently initializing replicas as their recovery source changes
removes relocation source of an initializing non-primary shard. this allows the replica shard to continue recovery from the primary even though its non-primary relocation source has failed.
marks a shard as temporarily ignored and adds it to the ignore unassigned list. should be used with caution, typically, the correct usage is to removeandignore from the iterator.
drains all unassigned shards and returns it. this method will not drain ignored shards.

puts primary shard indexroutings into initializing state
verifies that delayed allocation calculation are correct.
verifies that when a shard fails, reason is properly set and details are preserved.
tests that during reroute when a node is detected as leaving the cluster, the right unassigned meta is set
the unassigned meta is kept when a shard goes to initializing, but cleared when it moves to started.
returns the total number of shards within all groups
returns an iterator over active and initializing shards, ordered by the adaptive replica selection forumla. making sure though that its random within the active shards of the same (or missing) rank, and initializing shards are the last to iterate through.
adjust the for all other nodes' collected stats. in the original ranking paper there is no need to adjust other nodes' stats because cassandra sends occasional requests to all copies of the data, so their stats will be updated during that broadcast phase. in elasticsearch, however, we do not have that sort of broadcast-to-all behavior. in order to prevent a node that gets a high score and then never gets any more requests, we must ensure it eventually returns to a more normal score and can be a candidate for serving requests. this adjustment takes the "winning" node's statistics and adds the average of those statistics with each non-winning node. let's say the winning node had a queue size of 10 and a non-winning node had a queue of 18. the average queue size is (10 + 18) 2 = 14 so the non-winning node will have statistics added for a queue size of 14. this is repeated for the response time and service times as well.
returns an iterator over active and initializing shards. making sure though that its random within the active shards, and initializing shards are the last to iterate through.

tests serialization and deserialization.
creates a new routingallocation
returns whether the given node id should be ignored from consideration when allocationdeciders is deciding whether to allocate the specified shard id to that node. the node will be ignored if the specified shard failed on that node, triggering the current round of allocation. since the shard just failed on that node, we don't want to try to reassign it there, if the node is still a part of the cluster.
prevent set of insyncallocationids to grow unboundedly. this can happen for example if we don't write to a primary but repeatedly shut down nodes that have active replicas. we use number_of_replicas + 1 (= possible active shard copies) to bound the insyncallocationids set
assume following scenario: indexing request is written to primary, but fails to be replicated to active replica. the primary instructs master to fail replica before acknowledging write to client. in the meanwhile, the node of the replica was removed from the cluster (deassociatedeadnodes). this means that the shardrouting of the replica was failed, but it's allocation id is still part of the in-sync set. we have to make sure that the failshard request from the primary removes the allocation id from the in-sync set.
don't remove allocation id of failed active primary if there is no replica to promote as primary.
assume following scenario: indexing request is written to primary, but fails to be replicated to active replica. the primary instructs master to fail replica before acknowledging write to client. in the meanwhile, primary fails for an unrelated reason. master now batches both requests to fail primary and replica. we have to make sure that only the allocation id of the primary is kept in the in-sync allocation set before we acknowledge request to client. otherwise we would acknowledge a write that made it into the primary but not the replica but the replica is still considered non-stale.

builds the internal model from all shards in the given to a node. this method will skip shards in the state a shadow shard in the state shardroutingstate#initializing on the target node which we respect during the allocation balancing process. in short, this method recreates the status-quo in the cluster.
makes a decision on whether to move a started shard to another node. the following rules apply to the movedecision return object: 1. if the shard is not started, no decision will be taken and movedecision#isdecisiontaken() will return false. 2. if the shard is allowed to remain on its current node, no attempt will be made to move the shard and 3. if the shard is not allowed to remain on its current node, then movedecision#getallocationdecision() will be populated with the decision of moving to another node. if movedecision#forcemove() () returns true, then 4. if the method is invoked in explain mode (e.g. from the cluster allocation explain apis), then
makes a decision about moving a single shard to a different node to form a more optimally balanced cluster. this method is invoked from the cluster allocation explain api only.
move started shards that can not be allocated to a node anymore for each shard to be moved this function executes a move operation to the minimal eligible node with respect to the weight function. if a shard is moved the shard will be set to shard is created with an incremented version in the state
balances the nodes on the cluster model according to the weight function. the configured threshold is the minimum delta between the weight of the maximum node and the minimum node according to the distribute shards evenly per index. the balancer tries to relocate shards only if the delta exceeds the threshold. in the default case the threshold is set to 1.0 to enforce gaining relocation only, or in other words relocations that move the weight delta closer to 0.0
balances the nodes on the cluster model according to the weight function. the actual balancing is delegated to #balancebyweights()
make a decision for allocating an unassigned shard. this method returns a two values in a tuple: the first value is the decision taken to allocate the unassigned shard, the second value is the is of type type#no, then the assigned node will be null.
allocates all given shards on the minimal eligible node for the shards index with respect to the weight function. all given shards must be unassigned.
this builds a initial index ordering where the indices are returned in most unbalanced first. we need this in order to prevent over allocations on added nodes from one index when the weight parameters for global balance overrule the index balance at an intermediate state. for example this can happen if we have 3 nodes and 3 indices with 3 primary and 1 replica shards. at the first stage all three nodes hold 2 shard for each index. now we add another node and the first index is balanced moving three shards from two of the nodes over to the new node since it has no shards yet and global balance for the node is way below average. to re-balance we need to move shards back eventually likely to the nodes we relocated them from.
tries to find a relocation from the max node to the minimal node for an arbitrary shard of the given index on the balance model. iff this method returns a true the relocation has already been executed on the simulation model as well as on the cluster.
utility method for rejecting the current allocation command based on provided reason
handle case where a disco node cannot be found in the routing table. usually means that it's not a data node.
initializes an unassigned shard on a node and removes it from the unassigned
read from a stream.
utility method for rejecting the current allocation command based on provided exception
read from a stream.
reads a allocationcommands from a streaminput
writes allocationcommands to a streamoutput
executes all wrapped commands on a given routingallocation
reads allocationcommands from a xcontentparser  "commands" : [ "allocate" : "index" : "test", "shard" : 0, "node" : "test" ] 
read from a stream.
given the diskusage for a node and the size of the shard, return the percentage of free disk if the shard were to be allocated to the node.
returns the size of all shards that are currently being relocated to the node, but may not be finished transferring yet. if subtractshardsmovingaway is true then the size of shards moving away is subtracted from the total size of all shards
returns the expected shard size for the given shard or the default value provided if not enough information are available to estimate the shards size.
returns a diskusage for the routingnode using the average usage of other nodes in the disk usage map.
returns a decision whether the given primary shard can be forcibly allocated on the given node. this method should only be called for unassigned primary shards where the node has a shard copy on disk. note: all implementations that override this behavior should take into account the results of #canallocate(shardrouting, routingnode, routingallocation) before making a decision on force allocation, because force allocation should only be considered if all deciders return decision#no.
the shard routing passed to #canallocate(shardrouting, routingnode, routingallocation) is not the initializing shard to this node but: - the unassigned shard routing in case if we want to assign an unassigned shard to this node. - the initializing shard routing if we want to assign the initializing shard to this node instead - the started shard routing in case if we want to check if we can relocate to this node. - the relocating shard routing if we want to relocate to this node now instead. this method returns the corresponding initializing shard that would be allocated to this node.

sets the same routing for all indices
utility method that allows to resolve an index expression to its corresponding single concrete index. callers should make sure they provide proper org.elasticsearch.action.support.indicesoptions that require a single index as a result. the indices resolution must in fact return a single index when using this method, an illegalargumentexception gets thrown otherwise. and the expression that can be resolved to an alias or an index name.
identifies whether the first argument (an array containing index names) is a pattern that matches all indices
returns true iff the given expression resolves to the given index name otherwise false
utility method that allows to resolve an index expression to its corresponding single write index. and the expression that can be resolved to an alias or an index name.
iterates through the list of indices and selects the effective list of required aliases for the given index. only aliases where the given predicate tests successfully are returned. if the indices list contains a non-required reference to the index itself - null is returned. returns null if no filtering is required.
resolves the search routing if in the expression aliases are used. if expressions point to concrete indices or aliases with no routing defined the specified routing is used.
resolves the provided cluster expression to matching cluster names. this method only supports exact or wildcard matches.
finds the specific index aliases that match with the specified aliases directly or partially via wildcards and that point to the specified concrete indices or match partially with the indices via wildcards. present for that index
returns the indexmetadata for this index.
checks if at least one of the specified aliases exists in the specified concrete indices. wildcards are supported in the alias names for partial matches.
returns indexing routing for the given aliasorindex. resolves routing from the alias metadata used in the write index.
finds all mappings for types and concrete indices. types are expanded to include all types that match the glob patterns in the types array. empty types array, null or "_all" will be expanded to all types available for the given indices. only fields that match the provided field filter will be returned (default is a predicate that always returns true, which can be overridden via plugins)
validates an alias filter by parsing it using the provided org.elasticsearch.index.query.queryshardcontext
validates an alias filter by parsing it using the provided org.elasticsearch.index.query.queryshardcontext
validate a proposed alias.
allows to partially validate an alias, without knowing which index it'll get applied to. useful with index templates containing aliases. checks also that it is possible to parse the alias filter via org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.xcontentparser, without validating it as a filter though.
checks the mappings for compatibility with the current version
elasticsearch v6.0 no longer supports indices created pre v5.0. all indices that were created before elasticsearch v5.0 should be re-indexed in elasticsearch 5.x before they can be opened by this version of elasticsearch.
checks that the index can be upgraded to the current version of the master node.  if the index does not need upgrade it returns the index metadata unchanged, otherwise it returns a modified index metadata. if index cannot be updated the method throws an exception.
checks if the are replicas with the auto-expand feature that need to be adapted. returns a map of updates, which maps the indices to be updated to the desired number of replicas. the map has the desired number of replicas as key and the indices to update as value, as this allows the result of this method to be directly applied to routingtable.builder#updatenumberofreplicas.
updates the cluster block only iff the setting exists in the given settings
delete some indices from the cluster state.
validate the name for an index or alias against some static rules.
returns a default number of routing shards based on the number of shards of the index. the default number of routing shards will allow any index to be split at least once and at most 10 times by a factor of two. the closer the number or shards gets to 1024 the less default split operations are supported
validate the name for an index against some static rules and a cluster state.
validates the settings and mappings for shrinking an index.
creates an index in the cluster state and waits for the specified number of shard copies to become active (as specified in createindexclusterstateupdaterequest#waitforactiveshards()) before sending the response on the listener. if the index creation was successfully applied on the cluster state, then createindexclusterstateupdateresponse#isacknowledged() will return true, otherwise it will return false and no waiting will occur for started shards ( createindexclusterstateupdateresponse#isshardsacknowledged() will also be false). if the index creation in the cluster state was successful and the requisite shard copies were started before the timeout, then createindexclusterstateupdateresponse#isshardsacknowledged() will return true, otherwise if the operation timed out, then it will return false.
returns the unique alias metadata per concrete index. (note that although alias can point to the same concrete indices, each alias reference may have its own routing and filters)
build the operation.
build the operation.
sometimes, the default mapping exists and an actual mapping is not created yet (introduced), in this case, we want to return the default mapping in case it has some default mapping definitions.  note, once the mapping type is introduced, the default mapping is applied on the actual typed mappingmetadata, setting its routing, timestamp, and so on if needed.
returns the source shard ids to shrink into the given shard id.
selects the source shards for a local shard recovery. this might either be a split or a shrink operation.
returns the routing factor for and shrunk index with the given number of target shards. this factor is used in the hash function in hashing routing of documents even if the number of shards changed (ie. a shrunk index). are not divisible by the number of target shards.
returns the source shard id to split the given target shard off
adds human readable version and creation date settings. this method is used to display the settings in a human readable format in rest api
test whether the current index uuid is the same as the given one. returns true if either are _na_
batch method to apply all the queued refresh operations. the idea is to try and batch as much as possible so we won't create the same index all the time for example for the updates on the same mapping and generate a single cluster change event out of all of those.
refreshes mappings if they are not the same between original and parsed version
test resolving _all pattern (null, empty array or "_all") for random indicesoptions
test resolving wildcard pattern that matches no index of alias for random indicesoptions
finds index templates whose index pattern matched with the given index name. the result is sorted by indextemplatemetadata#order descending.
writes repository metadata to stream output
converts the serialized compressed form of the mappings into a parsed map.
purge tombstone entries. returns the number of entries that were purged. tombstones are purged if the number of tombstones in the list is greater than the input parameter of maximum allowed tombstones. tombstones are purged until the list is equal to the maximum allowed.
returns true if the graveyard contains a tombstone for the given index.
checks that when nodes leave the cluster that the auto-expand-replica functionality only triggers after failing the shards on the removed nodes. this ensures that active shards on other live nodes are not failed if the primary resided on a now dead node. instead, one of the replicas on the live nodes first gets promoted to primary, and the auto-expansion (removing replicas) only triggers in a follow-up step.
serializes information about a single repository
returns a repository with a given name or null if such repository doesn't exist
get the real number of parallel threads.
validate the parameters that the user has passed.
write to the status file. the status file will contain a string describing the exit status of the test. it will be success if the test returned success (return code 0), a numerical code if it returned a non-zero status, or in_progress or timed_out.
validate that source parameters look sane.
reads and returns the full contents of the specified file.
parses scm output and returns uri of scm.
returns a string representing current build time.

given a list of files, computes and returns an md5 checksum of the full contents of all files.
parses scm output and returns branch of scm.
converts bytes to a hexadecimal string representation and returns it.
computes and returns an md5 checksum of the contents of all files in the input maven fileset.
returns a string containing every element of the given list, with each element separated by a comma.
converts a maven fileset to a list of file objects.
creates a new outputbufferthread to consume the given inputstream.
pretty-print the environment to a stringbuilder.

unbuffered file copy from src to dst without tainting os buffer cache in posix platform: it uses filechannel#transferto() which internally attempts unbuffered io on os with native sendfile64() support and falls back to buffered io otherwise. it minimizes the number of filechannel#transferto call by passing the the src file size directly instead of a smaller size as the 3rd parameter. this saves the number of sendfile64() system call when native sendfile64() is supported. in the two fall back cases where sendfile is not supported, filechannle#transferto already has its own batching of size 8 mb and 8 kb, respectively. in windows platform: it uses its own native wrapper of copyfileex with copy_file_no_buffering flag, which is supported on windows server 2008 and above. ideally, we should use filechannel#transferto() across both posix and windows platform. unfortunately, the wrapper(java_sun_nio_ch_filechannelimpl_transferto0) used by filechannel#transferto for unbuffered io is not implemented on windows. based on openjdk 678 source code, java_sun_nio_ch_filechannelimpl_transferto0 on windows simply returns ios_unsupported. note: this simple native wrapper does minimal parameter checking before copy and consistency check (e.g., size) after copy. it is recommended to use wrapper function like the storage#nativecopyfileunbuffered() function in hadoop-hdfs with prepost copy checks.

unmaps the block from memory. see munmap(2). there isn't any portable way to unmap a memory region in java. so we use the sun.nio method here. note that unmapping a memory region could cause crashes if code continues to reference the unmapped code. however, if we don't manually unmap the memory, we are dependent on the finalizer to do it, and we have no idea when the finalizer will run.

resets everything, including the input buffer, regardless of whether the current gzip substream is finished.
parse the gzip trailer (assuming we're in the appropriate state). in order to deal with degenerate cases (e.g., user buffer is one byte long), we copy trailer bytes (all 8 of 'em) to a local buffer. see http:www.ietf.orgrfcrfc1952.txt for the gzip spec.
parse the gzip header (assuming we're in the appropriate state). in order to deal with degenerate cases (e.g., user buffer is one byte long), we copy (some) header bytes to another buffer. (filename, comment, and extra-field bytes are simply skipped.) see http:www.ietf.orgrfcrfc1952.txt for the gzip spec. note that no version of gzip to date (at least through 1.4.0, 2010-01-20) supports the fhcrc header-crc16 flagbit; instead, the implementation treats it as a multi-file continuation flag (which it also doesn't support). :-( sun's jdk v6 (1.6) supports the header crc, however, and so do we.

this method reads a byte from the compressed stream. whenever we need to read from the underlying compressed stream, this method should be called instead of directly calling the read method of the underlying compressed stream. this method does important record keeping to have the statistic that how many bytes have been read off the compressed stream.
this method tries to find the marker (passed to it as the first parameter) in the stream. it can find bit patterns of length <= 63 bits. specifically this method is used in cbzip2inputstream to find the end of block (eob) delimiter in the stream, starting from the current position of the stream. if marker is found, the stream position will be at the byte containing the starting bit of the marker.
initializes the #tt array. this method is called when the required length of the array is known. i don't initialize it at construction time to avoid unnecessary memory allocation when compressing small files.
in continous reading mode, this read method starts from the start of the compressed stream and end at the end of file by emitting un-compressed data. in this mode stream positioning is not announced and should be ignored. in byblock reading mode, this read method informs about the end of a bzip2 block by returning eob. at this event, the compressed stream position is also announced. this announcement tells that how much of the compressed stream has been de-compressed and read out of this class. in between eob events, the stream position is not updated. if the stream content is malformed or an io error occurs. of -1 means end of stream while -2 represents end of block

create a snapshot.
resets all statistics to 0. in order to reset, we add up all the thread-local statistics data, and set rootdata to the negative of that. this may seem like a counterintuitive way to reset the statistics. why can't we just zero out all the thread-local data? well, thread-local data can only be modified by the thread that owns it. if we tried to modify the thread-local data from this thread, our modification might get interleaved with a read-modify-write operation done by the thread that owns the data. that would result in our update getting lost. the approach used here avoids this problem because it only ever reads (not writes) the thread-local data. both reads and writes to rootdata are done under the lock, so we're free to modify rootdata from any thread that holds the lock.
in case of the symlinks or mount points, one has to move the appropriate trashbin in the actual volume of the path p being deleted. hence we get the file system of the fully-qualified resolved-path and then move the path p to the trashbin in that volume,

creates a symbolic link to an existing file. an exception is thrown if the symlink exits, the user does not have permission to create symlink, or the underlying file system does not support symlinks. symlink permissions are ignored, access to a symlink is determined by the permissions of the symlink target. symlinks in paths leading up to the final path component are resolved transparently. if the final path component refers to a symlink some functions operate on the symlink itself, these are: - delete(f) and deleteonexit(f) - deletes the symlink. - rename(src, dst) - if src refers to a symlink, the symlink is renamed. if dst refers to a symlink, the symlink is over-written. - getlinktarget(f) - returns the target of the symlink. - getfilelinkstatus(f) - returns a filestatus object describing the symlink. some functions, create() and mkdir(), expect the final path component does not exist. if they are given a path that refers to a symlink that does exist they behave as if the path referred to an existing file or directory. all other functions fully resolve, ie follow, the symlink. these are: open, setreplication, setowner, settimes, setworkingdirectory, setpermission, getfilechecksum, setverifychecksum, getfileblocklocations, getfsstatus, getfilestatus, exists, and liststatus. symlink targets are stored as given to createsymlink, assuming the underlying file system is capable of storing a fully qualified uri. dangling symlinks are permitted. filecontext supports four types of symlink targets, and resolves them as follows  given a path referring to a symlink of form: <---x---> fs:hostablink <-----y-----> in this path x is the scheme and authority that identify the file system, and y is the path leading up to the final path component "link". if y is a symlink itself then let y' be the target of y and x' be the scheme and authority of y'. symlink targets may: 1. fully qualified uris fs:hostxabfile resolved according to the target file system. 2. partially qualified uris (eg scheme but no host) fs:abfile resolved according to the target file system. eg resolving a symlink to hdfs:a results in an exception because hdfs uris must be fully qualified, while a symlink to file:a will not since hadoop's local file systems require partially qualified uris. 3. relative paths path resolves to [y'][path]. eg if y resolves to hdfs:hosta and path is "..bfile" then [y'][path] is hdfs:hostbfile 4. absolute paths path resolves to [x'][path]. eg if y resolves hdfs:hostab and path is "file" then [x][path] is hdfs:hostfile  false then parent must exist directory. target or link is not supported

create a jar file at the given path, containing a manifest with a classpath that references all specified entries. some platforms may have an upper limit on command line length. for example, the maximum command line length on windows is 8191 characters, but the length of the classpath may exceed this. to work around this limitation, use this method to create a small intermediate jar with a manifest that contains the full classpath. it returns the absolute path to the new jar, which the caller may set as the classpath for a new process. environment variable evaluation is not supported within a jar manifest, so this method expands environment variables before inserting classpath entries to the manifest. the method parses environment variables according to platform-specific syntax (%var% on windows, or $var otherwise). on windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. for example, %var% and %var% evaluate to the same value. specifying the classpath in a jar manifest does not support wildcards, so this method expands wildcards internally. any classpath entry that ends with is translated to all files at that path with extension .jar or .jar. for expansion unexpanded wild card entry path in position 1

record some set of values at the specified time into this helper. this can be useful to avoid fetching the current time twice if the caller has already done so for other purposes. this additionally allows the caller to specify a name for this recorder. when multiple names are used, one is denoted as the primary recorder. only recorders named as the primary will trigger logging; other names not matching the primary can only be triggered by following the primary. this is used to coordinate multiple logging points. a primary can be set via the is set in the constructor, then the first recorder name used becomes the primary. if multiple names are used, they maintain entirely different sets of values and summary information. for example:  initialize "pre" as the primary recorder name logthrottlinghelper helper = new logthrottlinghelper(1000, "pre"); logaction prelog = helper.record("pre", time.monotonicnow()); if (prelog.shouldlog()) ... double eventsprocessed = ... perform some action logaction postlog = helper.record("post", time.monotonicnow(), eventsprocessed); if (postlog.shouldlog()) ... can use postlog.getstats(0) to access eventsprocessed information  since "pre" is the primary recorder name, logging to "pre" will trigger a log action if enough time has elapsed. this will indicate that "post" should log as well. this ensures that "post" is always logged in the same iteration as "pre", yet each one is able to maintain its own summary information. other behavior is the same as #record(double...). current recorder is the primary. other names are arbitrary and are only used to differentiate between distinct recorders.

static method that provides null check for retrycache
constructor
this method handles the following conditions:  if retry is not to be processed, return null if there is no cache entry, add a new entry newentry and return it. if there is an existing entry, wait for its completion. if the completion state is cacheentry#failed, the expectation is that the thread that waited for completion, retries the request. the if the completion state is cacheentry#success, the entry is returned so that the thread that waits for it can can return previous response.

logs a slow rpc request. if this request took too much time relative to other requests we consider that as a slow rpc. 3 is a magic number that comes from 3 sigma deviation. a very simple explanation can be found by searching for 68-95-99.7 rule. we flag an rpc as slow rpc if and only if it falls above 99.7% of requests. we start this logic only once we have enough sample size.
this is a wrapper around writablebytechannel#write(bytebuffer). if the amount of data is large, it writes to channel in smaller chunks. this is to avoid jdk from creating many direct buffers as the size of buffer increases. this also minimizes extra copies in nio layer as a result of multiple write operations required to write a large buffer.

constructs a server listening on the named port and address. parameters passed must be of the named class. the handlercount determines the number of handler threads that will be used to process calls. if queuesizeperhandler or numreaders are not -1 they will be used instead of parameters from configuration. otherwise the configuration will be picked up. if rpcrequestclass is null then the rpcrequestclass must have been registered via #registerprotocolengine(rpc.rpckind, class, rpc.rpcinvoker) this parameter has been retained for compatibility with existing tests and usage.
establish rpc connection setup by negotiating sasl if required, then reading and authorizing the connection header negotiation failure, premature or invalid connection context, or other state errors. this exception needs to be sent to the client.
some exceptions ( retriableexception and standbyexception) that are wrapped as a cause of parameter e are unwrapped so that they can be sent as the true cause to the client side. in case of
this method reads in a non-blocking fashion from the channel: this method is called repeatedly when data is present in the channel; when it has enough data to process one rpc it processes that rpc. on the first pass, it processes the connectionheader, connectioncontext (an outofband rpc) and at most one rpc request that follows that. on future passes it will process at most one rpc request. quirky things: datalengthbuffer (4 bytes) is used to read "hrpc" or rpc request length. client, typically failure to respond to client

get the protocol name. if the protocol class has a protocolannotation, then get the protocol name from the annotation; otherwise the class name is the protocol name.
return the connection id of the given object. if the provided object is in fact a protocol translator, we'll get the connection id of the underlying proxy object.
build the rpc server.
get all superinterfaces that extend versionedprotocol
get the protocol version from protocol class. if the protocol class has a protocolannotation, then get the protocol version from the annotation; otherwise get it from the versionid field of the protocol class.
get a meaningful and short name for a server based on a java class. the rules are defined to support the current naming schema of the generated protobuf classes where the final class usually an anonymous inner class of an inner class. 1. for simple classes it returns with the simple name of the classes (with the name without package name) 2. for inner classes, this is the simple name of the inner class. 3. if it is an object created from a class factory e.g., org.apache.hadoop.ipc.testrpc$testclass$2 this method returns parent class testclass. 4. if it is an anonymous class e.g., 'org.apache.hadoop.ipc.testrpc$10' servernamefromclass returns parent class testrpc.

checks if queue is empty by checking at checkpoint_num points with checkpoint_interval_ms interval. this doesn't mean the queue might not fill up at some point later, but it should decrease the probability that we lose a call this way.
read the number of levels from the configuration. this will affect the faircallqueue's overall capacity.
replaces active queue with the newly requested one and transfers all calls to the newq before returning.
insert e into the backing queue or block until we can. if client backoff is enabled this method behaves like add which throws if the queue overflows. if we block and the queue changes on us, we will insert while the queue is drained.
retrieve an e from the backing queue or block until we can. guaranteed to return an element from the current queue.
check if a method is supported by the server or not
move to the next queue.
creates default weights for each queue. the weights are 2^n.
put the element in a queue of a specific priority.
returns maximum remaining capacity. this does not reflect how much you can ideally fit in this faircallqueue, as that would depend on the scheduler's decisions.
returns an element first non-empty queue equal to the priority returned by the multiplexer or scans from highest to lowest priority queue. caller must always acquire a semaphore permit before invoking. everything was empty
create a faircallqueue. notes: each sub-queue has a capacity of `capacity numsubqueues`. the first or the highest priority sub-queue has an excess capacity of `capacity % numsubqueues`
add, put, and offer follow the same pattern: 1. get the assigned prioritylevel from the call by scheduler 2. get the nth sub-queue matching this prioritylevel 3. delegate the call to this sub-queue. but differ in how they handle overflow: - add will move on to the next queue, throw on last queue overflow - put will move on to the next queue, block on last queue overflow - offer does not attempt other queues on overflow
offer the element to queue of the given or lower priority.
offer the element to queue of a specific priority.
drainto defers to each sub-queue. note that draining from a faircallqueue to another faircallqueue will likely fail, since the incoming calls may be scheduled differently in the new faircallqueue. nonetheless this method is provided for completeness.
peek, like poll, provides no strict consistency.

the time after which a rpc will timeout.
connect to the server and set up the io streams. it then sends a header to the server and starts the connection thread that waits for responses.
get executor on which ipc calls' parameters are sent. if the internal reference counter is zero, this method creates the instance of executor. if not, this method just returns the reference of clientexecutor.
check the rpc response header.
stop all threads related to this client. no further calls may be made using this client.
indicate when the call is complete and the value or error are available. notifies by default.
close the connection.
get a connection from the pool, or create a new one and add it to the pool. connections to a given connectionid are reused.
if multiple clients with the same principal try to connect to the same server at the same time, the server assumes a replay attack is in progress. this is a feature of kerberos. in order to work around this, what is done is that the client backs off randomly and tries to initiate the connection again. the other problem is to do with ticket expiry. to handle that, a relogin is attempted.
construct an ipc client whose values are of the given writable class.
update the server address if the address corresponding to the host name has changed.
convert an rpc method to a string. the format we want is 'methodouterclassshortname#methodname'. for example, if the method is: org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.proto.clientnamenodeprotocolprotos. clientnamenodeprotocol.blockinginterface.getserverdefaults the format we want is: clientnamenodeprotocol#getserverdefaults
returns whether the given method is supported or not. the protocol signatures are fetched and cached. the connection id for the proxy provided is re-used.
convert an rpc class method to a string. the format we want is 'secondoutermostclassshortname#outermostclassshortname'. for example, if the full class name is: org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.clientprotocol.getblocklocations the format we want is: clientprotocol#getblocklocations

register the rpcrequest deserializer for writablerpcengine
this constructor takes a connectionid, instead of creating a new one.
this is the client side invoker of rpc method. it only throws serviceexception, since the invocation proxy expects only serviceexception to be thrown by the method in case protobuf service. serviceexception has the following causes:  exceptions encountered on the client side in this method are set as cause in serviceexception as is. exceptions from the server are wrapped in remoteexception and are set as cause in serviceexception  note that the client calling protobuf rpc methods, must handle serviceexception by getting the cause from the serviceexception. if the cause is remoteexception, then unwrap it to get the exception thrown by the server.
if this remote exception wraps up one of the lookuptypes then return this exception.  unwraps any ioexception.

try to create a saslclient for an authentication type. may return null if the type isn't supported or the client lacks the required credentials.
release resources used by wrapped saslclient
evaluate the server provided challenge. the server must send a token if it's not done. if the server is done, the challenge token is optional because not all mechanisms send a final token for the client to update its internal state. the client must also be done after evaluating the optional token to ensure a malicious server doesn't prematurely end the negotiation with a phony success.
try to locate the required token for the server.
add group to cache
get netgroups for a given user
identify the sasl properties to be used for a connection with a client.
get the group memberships of a given user. if the user's group is not cached, this method may block.
get the groups being used to map user-to-groups.
create new groups used to map user-to-groups with loaded configuration.
this method will block if a cache entry doesn't exist, and any subsequent requests for the same user will wait on this request to return. if a user already exists in the cache, and when the key expires, the first call to reload the key will block, but subsequent requests will return the old value until the blocking thread returns. if reloadgroupsinbackground is true, then the thread that needs to refresh an expired key will not block either. instead it will return the old cache value and schedule a background refresh
override the reload method to provide an asynchronous implementation. if reloadgroupsinbackground is false, then this method defers to the super implementation, otherwise is arranges for the cache to be updated later
refresh all user-to-groups mappings.
queries impl for groups belonging to the user. this could involve io and take awhile.

add a group to cache, only netgroups are cached
calls jni function to get users for a netgroup, since c functions are not reentrant we need to make this synchronized (see documentation for setnetgrent, getnetgrent and endnetgrent)
check if the executor had a timeout and logs the event.
get the current user's group list from unix by running the command 'groups' note. for non-existing user it will return empty list. group is returned first.

construct a token from a tokenproto.
never call this method directly.
given a renewer, add delegation tokens for issuer and it's child issuers to the credentials object if it is not already present.  note: this method is not intended to be overridden. issuers should implement getcanonicalservice and getdelegationtoken to ensure consistent token acquisition behavior.
parse the command line arguments and initialize subcommand. also will attempt to perform kerberos login if both -principal and -keytab flags are passed in args array.
parse arguments looking for kerberos keytabprincipal. if both are found: remove both from the argument list and attempt login. if only one of the two is found: remove it from argument list, log warning and do not attempt login. if neither is found: return original args array, doing nothing. return the pruned args array if either flag is present.

this method is overridden to restrict http authentication schemes available for delegation token management functionality. the authentication schemes to be used for delegation token management are configured using delegation_token_schemes_property the basic logic here is to check if the current request is for delegation token management. if yes then check if the request contains an "authorization" header. if it is missing, then return the http 401 response with www-authenticate header for each scheme configured for delegation token management. it is also possible for a client to preemptively send authorization header for a scheme not configured for delegation token management. we detect this case and return the http 401 response with www-authenticate header for each scheme configured for delegation token management. if a client has sent a request with "authorization" header for a scheme configured for delegation token management, then it is forwarded to underlying multischemeauthenticationhandler for actual authentication. finally all other requests (excluding delegation token management) are forwarded to underlying multischemeauthenticationhandler for actual authentication.
returns an authenticated httpurlconnection. if the delegation token is present, it will be used taking precedence over the configured authenticator. if the doas parameter is not null, the request will be done on behalf of the specified doas user. as self.

store the results of the last attempt to become active. this is used so that, during manually initiated failover, we can report back the results of the attempt to become active to the initiator of the failover.
ensure that the local node is in a healthy state, and thus eligible for graceful failover.
wait until one of the following events:  another thread publishes the results of an attempt to become active using #recordactiveattempt(activeattemptrecord) the node enters bad health status the specified timeout elapses  service becomes unhealthy
coordinate a graceful failover to this node.
ask the remote zkfc to cede its active status and wait for the specified timeout before attempting to claim leader status.
coordinate a graceful failover. this proceeds in several phases: 1) pre-flight checks: ensure that the local node is healthy, and thus a candidate for failover. 2a) determine the current active node. if it is the local node, no need to failover - return success. 2b) get the other nodes 3a) ask the other nodes to yield from election for a number of seconds 3b) ask the active node to yield from the election for a number of seconds. 4) allow the normal election path to run in other threads. wait until we either become unhealthy or we see an election attempt recorded by the normal code path. 5) allow the old active to rejoin the election, so a future failback is possible.
check the current state of the service, and join the election if it should be in the election.

request from graceful failover to cede active role. causes this zkfc to transition its local node to standby, then quit the election for the specified period of time, after which it will rejoin iff it is healthy.
schedule a call to #recheckelectability() in the future.
perform pre-failover checks on the given service we plan to failover to, eg to prevent failing over to a service (eg due to it being inaccessible, already active, not healthy, etc). an option to ignore tosvc if it claims it is not ready to become active is provided in case performing a failover will allow it to become active, eg because it triggers a log roll so the standby can learn about new blocks and leave safemode.
failover from service 1 to service 2. if the failover fails then try to failback.
try to get the ha state of the node at the given address. this function is guaranteed to be "quick" -- ie it has a short timeout and no retries. its only purpose is to avoid fencing a node that has already restarted.
hook to allow subclasses to add any parameters they would like to expose to fencing implementationsscripts. fencing methods are free to use this map as they see fit -- notably, the shell script implementation takes each entry, prepends 'target_', substitutes '_' for '.', and adds it to the environment of the script. subclass implementations should be sure to delegate to the superclass implementation as well as adding their own keys.
interface implementation of zookeeper callback for monitor (exists)
get a new zookeeper client instance. protected so that test class can inherit and mock out the zookeeper instance
to participate in election, the app will call joinelection. the result will be notified by a callback on either the becomeactive or becomestandby app interfaces.  after this the elector will automatically monitor the leader status and perform re-election if necessary the app could potentially start off in standby mode and ignore the becomestandby call. to be set by the app. non-null data must be set. if valid data is not supplied
try to delete the "activebreadcrumb" node when gracefully giving up active status. if this fails, it will simply warn, since the graceful release behavior is only an optimization.
clear all of the state held within the parent znode. this recursively deletes everything within the znode as well as the parent znode itself. it should only be used when it's certain that no electors are currently participating in the election.
the callbacks and watchers pass a reference to the zk client which made the original call. we don't want to take action based on any callbacks from prior clients after we quit the election.

interface implementation of zookeeper watch events (connection and node), proxied by watcherwithclientref.
interface implementation of zookeeper callback for create
any service instance can drop out of the election by calling quitelection.  this will lose any leader status, if held, and stop monitoring of the lock node.  if the instance wants to participate in election again, then it needs to call joinelection().  this allows service instances to take themselves out of rotation for known impending unavailable states (e.g. long gc pause or software upgrade). if a failover occurs due to dropping out of the election.
if there is a breadcrumb node indicating that another node may need fencing, try to fence that node. if no breadcrumb node existed
create a new activestandbyelector object  the elector is created by providing to it the zookeeper configuration, the parent znode under which to create the znode and a reference to the callback interface.  the parent znode name must be the same for all service instances and different across services.  after the leader has been lost, a new leader will be elected after the session timeout expires. hence, the app must set this parameter based on its needs for failure response time. the session timeout must be greater than the zookeeper disconnect timeout and is recommended to be 3x that value to enable zookeeper to retry transient disconnections. setting a very short session timeout may result in frequent transitions between active and standby states during issues like network outagesgs pauses. zookeeper hostport for all zookeeper servers zookeeper session timeout znode under which to create the lock zookeeper acl's zk connection reference to callback interface object whether need to add the retry when establishing zk connection.
get data set by the active leader when there is no active leader other zookeeper operation errors when zookeeper connection could not be established
utility function to ensure that the configured base znode exists. this recursively creates the znode as well as all of its parents.
write the "activebreadcrumb" node, indicating that this node may need to be fenced on failover.
checks whether other target node is active or not occurred and forceactive was set otherwise false
ensure that we are allowed to manually manage the ha state of the target service. if automatic failover is configured, then the automatic failover controllers should be doing state management, and it is generally an error to use the haadmin command line to do so.
initiate a graceful failover by talking to the target node's zkfc. this sends an rpc to the zkfc, which coordinates the failover.
add cli options which are specific to the failover command and no others.

set the socket address a client can use to connect for the name property as a host:port. the wildcard address is replaced with the local host's address. if the host and address properties are configured the host component of the address will be combined with the port component of the addr to generate the address. this is to allow optional control over which host name is used in multi-home bind-host cases where a host can have multiple names
writes out all properties and their attributes (final and resource) to the given writer, the format of the output would be,  "properties" : [ key : "key1", value : "value1", isfinal : "key1.isfinal", resource : "key1.resource" , key : "key2", value : "value2", isfinal : "ke2.isfinal", resource : "key2.resource" ]  it does not output the properties of the configuration object which is loaded from an input stream.

return time duration in the given time unit. valid units are encoded in properties as suffixes: nanoseconds (ns), microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), and days (d).
gets information about why a property was set. typically this is the path to the resource objects (file, url, etc.) the property came from, but it can also indicate that it was set programmatically, or because of the command line. returns a list of the sources of the resource. the older sources are the first ones in the list. so for example if a configuration is set from the command line, and then written out to a file that is read back in the first entry would indicate that it was set from the command line, while the second one would indicate the file that the new configuration was read in from.
adds a set of deprecated keys to the global deprecations. this method is lockless. it works by means of creating a new deprecationcontext based on the old one, and then atomically swapping in the new context. if someone else updated the context in between us reading the old context and swapping in the new one, we try again until we win the race.

get a local file name under a directory named in dirsprop with the given path. if dirsprop contains multiple directories, then one is chosen based on path's hash code. if the selected directory does not exist, an attempt is made to create it.
writes properties and their attributes (final and resource) to the given writer.  when propertyname is not empty, and the property exists in the configuration, the format of the output would be,  "property": "key" : "key1", "value" : "value1", "isfinal" : "key1.isfinal", "resource" : "key1.resource"    when propertyname is null or empty, it behaves same as output would be,  "properties" : [ key : "key1", value : "value1", isfinal : "key1.isfinal", resource : "key1.resource" , key : "key2", value : "value2", isfinal : "ke2.isfinal", resource : "key2.resource" ]    when propertyname is not empty, and the property is not found in the configuration, this method will throw an   empty and the property is not found in configuration
print a warning if a property with a given name already exists with a different value
returns alternative names (non-deprecated keys or previously-set deprecated keys) for a given non-deprecated key. if the given key is deprecated, return null.
this is a manual implementation of the following regex "\\$\\[^\\\\$\u0020]+\\". it can be 15x more efficient than a regex matcher as demonstrated by hadoop-11506. this is noticeable with hadoop apps building on the assumption configuration#get is an o(1) hash table lookup, especially when the eval is a long string. eval.substring(res[0], res[1]) is "var" for the left-most occurrence of $var in eval. if no variable is found -1, -1 is returned.

get the value of the name property as a class. if no such property is specified, then defaultvalue is returned. or defaultvalue.
add tags defined in hadoop_tags_system, hadoop_tags_custom.
adds the deprecated key to the global deprecation map. it does not override any existing entries in the deprecation map. this is to be used only by the developers in order to add deprecation of keys, and attempts to call this method after loading resources once, would lead to unsupportedoperationexception if a key is deprecated in favor of multiple keys, they are all treated as aliases of each other, and setting any one of them resets all the others to the new value. if you have multiple deprecation entries to add, it is more efficient to use #adddeprecations(deprecationdelta[] deltas) instead. string custommessage) instead

returns whether or not a deprecated name has been warned. if the name is not deprecated then always return false
get the value of the name property as a boolean. if no such property is specified, or if the specified value is not a valid boolean, then defaultvalue is returned. or defaultvalue.
method to provide the warning message. it gives the custom message if non-null, and default message otherwise.
checks for the presence of the property name in the deprecation map. returns the first of the list of new keys if present in the deprecation map or the name itself. if the property is not presently set but the property map contains an entry for the deprecated key, the value of the deprecated key is set as the value for the provided property name. the name or the name itself.
write out the non-default properties in this configuration to the given writer.  when property name is not empty and the property exists in the configuration, this method writes the property and its attributes to the writer.    when property name is null or empty, this method writes all the configuration properties and their attributes to the writer.    when property name is not empty but the property doesn't exist in the configuration, this method throws an illegalargumentexception.  
a new configuration where the behavior of reading from the default resources can be turned off. if the parameter loaddefaults is false, the new instance will not load resources from the default files.
load a class by name, returning null rather than throwing an exception if it couldn't be loaded. this is to avoid the overhead of creating an exception.

adds a static resolution for host. this can be used for setting up hostnames with names that are fake to point to a well known host. for e.g. in some testcases we require to have daemons with different hostnames running on the same machine. in order to create connections to these daemons, one can set up mappings from those hostnames to "localhost". the actual hostname.
return a socketinputwrapper for the socket and set the given timeout. if the socket does not have an associated channel, then its socket timeout will be set to the specified value. otherwise, a timeout. any socket created using socket factories returned by #netutils, must use this interface instead of socket#getinputstream(). in general, this should be called only once on each socket: see the note in socketinputwrapper#settimeout(long) for more information. long as necessary.
returns an inetsocketaddress that a client can use to connect to the given listening address.

create an inetsocketaddress from the given target string and default port. if the string cannot be parsed correctly, the configname parameter is used as part of the exception message, allowing the user to better diagnose the misconfiguration. include a port number target was loaded. this is used in the exception message in the case that parsing fails.
returns outputstream for the socket. if the socket has an associated socketchannel then it returns a have a channel, socket#getoutputstream() is returned. in the later case, the timeout argument is ignored and the write will wait until data is available. any socket created using socket factories returned by netutils, must use this interface instead of socket#getoutputstream(). for waiting as long as necessary.
this is used to get all the resolutions that were added using value is a list each element of which contains an array of string of the form string[0]=hostname, string[1]=resolved-hostname
get the socket factory for the given class according to its configuration parameter hadoop.rpc.socket.factory.class.<classname>. when no such parameter exists then fall back on the default socket factory as configured by hadoop.rpc.socket.factory.class.default. if this default socket factory is not configured, then fall back on the jvm default socket factory.

takes one selector from end of lru list of free selectors. if there are no selectors awailable, it creates a new selector. also invokes trimidleselectors().
performs one io and returns number of bytes read or written. it waits up to the specified timeout. if the channel is not read before the timeout, sockettimeoutexception is thrown. selectionkey.op_read while reading and selectionkey.op_write while writing.
closes selectors that are idle for idle_timeout (10 sec). it does not traverse the whole list, just over the one that have crossed the timeout.
the contract is similar to socketchannel#connect(socketaddress) with a timeout.
this is similar to #doio(bytebuffer, int) except that it does not perform any io. it just waits for the channel to be ready for io as specified in ops. if select on the channel times out. if any other io error occurs.
utility function to check if channel is ok. mainly to throw ioexception instead of runtime exception in case of mismatch. this mismatch can occur for many runtime reasons.
waits on the channel with the given timeout using one of the cached selectors. it also removes any cached selectors that are idle for a few seconds.
create a new ouput stream with the given timeout. if the timeout is zero, it will be treated as infinite timeout. the socket's channel will be configured to be non-blocking. channel for writing, should also be a selectablechannel. the channel will be configured to be non-blocking.
transfers data from filechannel using updates waitforwritabletime and transfertotime with the time spent blocked on the network and the time spent transferring data from disk to network respectively. similar to readfully(), this waits till requested amount of data is transfered. to become writable if end of input file is reached before requested number of bytes are transfered. if this channel blocks transfer longer than timeout for this stream.

composes numchecksumstoread additional crcs into the current digest out of checksumin, with each crc expected to correspond to exactly
updates with a single additional crc which corresponds to an underlying data size of bytespercrc.
composes length crc_size_in_bytes more crcs from crcbuffer, with each crc expected to correspond to exactly bytespercrc underlying data bytes.
returns a crccomposer which will collapse crcs for every combined underlying data size which aligns with the specified stripe boundary. for example, if "update" is called with 20 crcs and bytespercrc == 5, and stripelength == 10, then every two (10 5) consecutive crcs will be combined with each other, yielding a list of 10 crc "stripes" in the final digest, each corresponding to 10 underlying data bytes. using a stripelength greater than the total underlying data size is equivalent to using a non-striped crccomposer.
returns byte representation of composed crcs; if no stripelength was specified, the digest should be of length equal to exactly one crc. otherwise, the number of crcs in the returned array is equal to the total sum bytespercrc divided by stripelength. if the sum of bytespercrc is not a multiple of stripelength, then the last crc in the array corresponds to totallength % stripelength underlying data bytes.

it enforces the the kerberos spnego authentication sequence returning an completed successfully. and valid, null if it is in progress (in this case the handler handles the response to the client).
this method parses the user-agent string and returns whether or not it refers to a browser. if its not a browser, then kerberos authentication will be used; if it is a browser, alternateauthenticate from the subclass will be used.  a user-agent string is considered to be a browser if it does not contain any of the values from alt-kerberos.non-browser.user-agents; the default behavior is to consider everything a browser unless it contains one of: "java", "curl", "wget", or "perl". subclasses can optionally override this method to use different behavior.
implements the spnego authentication sequence interaction using the current default principal in the kerberos cache (normally set via kinit).
performs spnego authentication against the specified url.  if a token is given it does a nop and returns the given token.  if no token is given, it will perform the spnego authentication sequence using an http options request.

private constructor to share common code between impl-based delegate and reference-based delegate (cannot use method such as init() to share common code, due the use of final fields).
deduce the parameter names for an advice method. see the aspectjadviceparameternamediscoverer class level javadoc for this class for details of the algorithm used.
match the given list of extracted variable names to argument slots.
an advice method can never be a constructor in spring.
parse the string pointcut expression looking for this(), target() and args() expressions. if we find one, try and extract a candidate variable name and bind it.
if a returning variable was specified and there is only one choice remaining, bind it.
parse the string pointcut expression looking for: @this, @target, @args, @within, @withincode, @annotation. if we find one of these pointcut expressions, try and extract a candidate variable name (or variable names, in the case of args). some more support from aspectj in doing this exercise would be nice... :)
match up args against unbound arguments of primitive types.
given an args pointcut body (could be args or at_args), add any candidate variable names to the given list.
if a throwing name was specified and there is exactly one choice remaining (argument that is a subtype of throwable) then bind it.
following aspectj semantics, if a return value is null (or return type is void), then the return type of target method should be used to determine whether advice is invoked or not. also, even if the return type is void, if the type of argument declared in the advice method is object, then the advice must still get invoked.
create a new aspectjpointcutadvisor for the given advice.
return the aspectjprecedenceinformation provided by this advisor or its advice. if neither the advisor nor the advice have precedence information, this method will return null.
return true if the advisor is a form of before advice.
return true if the advisor is a form of after advice.
all parameters from argumentindexoffset onwards are candidates for pointcut parameters - but returning and throwing vars are handled differently and must be removed from the list if present.
take the arguments at the method execution join point and output a set of arguments to the advice method.
create a parameternamediscoverer to be used for argument binding. the default implementation creates a defaultparameternamediscoverer and adds a specifically configured aspectjadviceparameternamediscoverer.
build a 'safe' pointcut that excludes the aspectj advice method itself.
get the current join point match at the join point we are being dispatched on.
we need to hold the throwing name at this level for argument binding calculations, this method allows the afterthrowing advice subclass to set the name.
create a new abstractaspectjadvice for the given advice method.
lazily instantiate joinpoint for the current invocation. requires methodinvocation to be bound with exposeinvocationinterceptor. do not use if access is available to the current reflectivemethodinvocation (in an around advice). spring aop invocation.
we need to hold the returning name at this level for argument binding calculations, this method allows the afterreturning advice subclass to set the name.
add special advisors if necessary to work with a proxy chain that contains aspectj advisors. this will expose the current spring aop invocation (necessary for some aspectj pointcut matching) and make available the current aspectj joinpoint. the call will have no effect if there are no aspectj advisors in the advisor chain.
determine whether the given advisor contains an aspectj advice.
initialize the underlying aspectj pointcut parser.
create a new aspectjexpressionpointcut with the given settings.
get a new pointcut expression based on a target class's loader rather than the default.
build the underlying aspectj pointcut expression.
check whether this pointcut is ready to match, lazily building the underlying aspectj pointcut expression.
sort the rest by aspectj precedence. if two pieces of advice have come from the same aspect they will have the same order. advice from the same aspect is then further ordered according to the following rules:  if either of the pair is after advice, then the advice declared last gets highest precedence (runs last) otherwise the advice declared first gets highest precedence (runs first)  important: advisors are sorted in precedence order, from highest precedence to lowest. "on the way in" to a join point, the highest precedence advisor should run first. "on the way out" of a join point, the highest precedence advisor should run last.
check whether the given aspect bean is eligible for auto-proxying. if no <aop:include> elements were used then "includepatterns" will be then one of the patterns must match.
set a list of regex patterns, matching eligible @aspectj bean names. default is to consider all @aspectj beans as eligible.
duplicates some logic from getadvice, but importantly does not force creation of the advice.
build a org.springframework.aop.aspectj.declareparentsadvisor for the given introduction field. resulting advisors will need to be evaluated for targets.
create an aspectmetadata instance for the supplied aspect type.
get the singleton aspect instance for the supplied aspect type. an instance is created if one cannot be found in the instance cache.
add an aspect of the supplied type to the end of the advice chain.
add the supplied aspect instance to the chain. the type of the aspect instance supplied must be a singleton aspect. true singleton lifecycle is not honoured when using this method - the caller is responsible for managing the lifecycle of any aspects added in this way.
create a metadataawareaspectinstancefactory for the supplied aspect type. if the aspect type has no per clause, then a singletonmetadataawareaspectinstancefactory is returned, otherwise a prototypeaspectinstancefactory is returned.
create a beanfactoryaspectinstancefactory, providing a type that aspectj should introspect to create ajtype metadata. use if the beanfactory may consider the type to be a subclass (as when using cglib), and the information should relate to a superclass. ( null indicates resolution through beanfactory#gettype via the bean name)
look for aspectj-annotated aspect beans in the current bean factory, and return to a list of spring aop advisors representing them. creates a spring advisor for each aspectj advice method.
we need to detect this as "code-style" aspectj aspects should not be interpreted by spring aop.
create a new aspectmetadata instance for the given aspect class.
extract contents from string of form pertarget(contents).
create a prototypeaspectinstancefactory. aspectj will be called to introspect to create ajtype metadata using the type returned for the given bean name from the beanfactory.
set the owning beanfactory. we need to save a reference so that we can use the getbean method on every invocation.
replaces this object with a singletontargetsource on serialization. protected as otherwise it won't be invoked for subclasses. (the writereplace() method must be visible to the class being serialized.) with this implementation of this method, there is no need to mark non-serializable fields in this class or subclasses as transient.
returns the lazy-initialized target object, creating it on-the-fly if it doesn't exist already.
subclasses can override this if they want to return a specific commons pool. they should apply any configuration properties to the pool here. default is a genericobjectpool instance with the given pool size.
activate this proxy configuration.
propagate advice change event to all advisedsupportlisteners.
create the advisor (interceptor) chain. advisors that are sourced from a beanfactory will be refreshed each time a new prototype instance is added. interceptors added programmatically through the factory api are unaffected by such changes.
invoked when advice chain is created. add the given advice, advisor or object to the interceptor list. because of these three possibilities, we can't type the signature more strongly. bean factory
add all global interceptors and pointcuts.
look at bean factory metadata to work out whether this bean name, which concludes the interceptornames list, is an advisor or advice, or may be a target.
check the interceptornames list whether it contains a target name as final element. if found, remove the final name from the list and set it as targetname.
blow away and recache singleton on an advice change.
convert the following object sourced from calling getbean() on a name in the interceptornames array to an advisor or targetsource.
return an independent advisor chain. we need to do this every time a new prototype instance is returned, to return distinct instances of prototype advisors and advices.
return a proxy. invoked when clients obtain beans from this factory bean. create an instance of the aop proxy to be returned by this factory. the instance will be cached for a singleton, and create on each call to
return the singleton instance of this class's proxy object, lazily creating it if it hasn't been created already.
return a targetsource to use when creating a proxy. if the target was not specified at the end of the interceptornames list, the targetsource will be this class's targetsource member. otherwise, we get the target bean and wrap it in a targetsource if necessary.
create a new prototype instance of this class's created proxy object, backed by an independent advisedsupport configuration.

create a new cglibaopproxy for the given aop configuration. exception in this case, rather than let a mysterious failure happen later.
set constructor arguments to use for creating the proxy.
implementation of callbackfilter.accept() to return the index of the callback we need. the callbacks for each proxy are built up of a set of fixed callbacks for general use and then a set of callbacks that are specific to a method for use on static targets with a fixed advice chain. the callback used is determined thus:  for exposed proxies exposing the proxy requires code to execute before and after the methodchain invocation. this means we must use dynamicadvisedinterceptor, since all other interceptors can avoid the need for a trycatch block for object.finalize(): no override for this method is used. for equals(): the equalsinterceptor is used to redirect equals() calls to a special handler to this proxy. for methods on the advised class: the adviseddispatcher is used to dispatch the call directly to the target for advised methods: if the target is static and the advice chain is frozen then a fixedchainstatictargetinterceptor specific to the method is used to invoke the advice chain. otherwise a dynamicadvisedinterceptor is used. for non-advised methods: where it can be determined that the method will not return this or when proxyfactory.getexposeproxy() returns false, then a dispatcher is used. for static targets, the staticdispatcher is used; and for dynamic targets, a dynamicunadvisedinterceptor is used. if it possible for the method to return this then a staticunadvisedinterceptor is used for static targets - the dynamicunadvisedinterceptor already considers this. 
checks to see whether the supplied class has already been validated and validates it if not.
checks for final methods on the given class, as well as package-visible methods across classloaders, and writes warnings to the log for each one found.
determine a targetsource for the given target (or targetsource). used as our targetsource; otherwise it is wrapped in a singletontargetsource.
create a proxy for the specified targetsource that extends the target class of the targetsource.
make the given proxy available via the currentproxy() method. note that the caller should be careful to keep the old value as appropriate.
try to return the current aop proxy. this method is usable only if the calling method has been invoked via aop, and the aop framework has been set to expose proxies. otherwise, this method will throw an illegalstateexception. method was invoked outside an aop invocation context, or because the aop framework has not been configured to expose the proxy

build a configuration-only copy of this advisedsupport, replacing the targetsource.
prepare a proxyfactory for the given bean. subclasses may customize the handling of the target instance and in particular the exposure of the target class. the default introspection of interfaces for non-target-class proxies and the configured advisor will be applied afterwards; #customizeproxyfactory allows for late customizations of those parts right before proxy creation.
check the interfaces on the given bean class and apply them to the proxyfactory, if appropriate. calls #isconfigurationcallbackinterface and #isinternallanguageinterface to filter for reasonable proxy interfaces, falling back to a target-class proxy otherwise.
determine whether the given interface is a well-known internal language interface and therefore not to be considered as a reasonable proxy interface. if no reasonable proxy interface is found for a given bean, it will get proxied with its full target class, assuming that as the user's intention.
determine the ultimate target class of the given bean instance, traversing not only a top-level proxy but any number of nested proxies as well — as long as possible without side effects, that is, just for singleton targets. object as fallback; never null)

determine the complete set of interfaces to proxy for the given aop configuration. this will always add the advised interface unless the advisedsupport's
determine whether the advisors contain matching introductions.
this implementation returns a shallow copy of this invocation object, including an independent copy of the original arguments array. we want a shallow copy in this case: we want to use the same interceptor chain and other object references, but we want an independent value for the current interceptor index.
return user attributes associated with this invocation. this method provides an invocation-bound alternative to a threadlocal. this map is initialized lazily and is not used in the aop framework itself. (never null)
this implementation returns a shallow copy of this invocation object, using the given arguments array for the clone. we want a shallow copy in this case: we want to use the same interceptor chain and other object references, but we want an independent value for the current interceptor index.
set the names of the beans that should automatically get wrapped with proxies. a name can specify a prefix to match by ending with "", e.g. "mybean,tx" will match the bean named "mybean" and all beans whose name start with "tx". note: in case of a factorybean, only the objects created by the factorybean will get proxied. this default behavior applies as of spring 2.0. if you intend to proxy a factorybean instance itself (a rare use case, but spring 1.2's default behavior), specify the bean name of the factorybean including the factory-bean prefix  e.g. 
identify as bean to proxy if the bean name is in the configured list of names.
find all eligible advisor beans in the current bean factory, ignoring factorybeans and excluding beans that are currently in creation.
create a target source for bean instances. uses any targetsourcecreators if set. returns null if no custom targetsource should be used. this implementation uses the "customtargetsourcecreators" property. subclasses can override this method to use a different mechanism.

augment the default junit behavior execution chain. furthermore, support for timeouts has been moved down the execution chain in order to include execution of org.junit.before @before and org.junit.after @after methods within the timed execution. note that this differs from the default junit behavior of executing executing the actual test method in a separate thread. thus, the net effect is that @before and @after methods will be executed in the same thread as the test method. as a consequence, junit-specified timeouts will work fine in combination with spring transactions. however, junit-specific timeouts still differ from spring-specific timeouts in that the former execute in a separate thread while the latter simply execute in the main thread (like regular tests).

send a redirect back to the http client.
determine name-value pairs for query strings, which will be stringified, url-encoded and formatted by #appendqueryproperties. this implementation filters the model through checking by default accepting strings, primitives and primitive wrappers only.
whether the given targeturl has a host that is a "foreign" system in which case httpservletresponse#encoderedirecturl will not be applied. this method returns true if the #sethosts(string[]) property is configured and the target url has a host that does not match. the url does not have a host or the "host" property is not configured.

set static attributes for this view from a map. this allows to set any kind of attribute values, for example bean references. "static" attributes are fixed attributes that are specified in the view instance configuration. "dynamic" attributes, on the other hand, are values passed in as part of the model. can be populated with a "map" or "props" element in xml bean definitions.
prepare the given response for rendering. the default implementation applies a workaround for an ie bug when sending download content via https.

resolve a template from the given template path. the default implementation uses the locale associated with the current request, as obtained through org.springframework.context.i18n.localecontextholder localecontextholder, to find the template file. effectively the locale configured at the engine level is ignored.
filter and optionally wrap the model in mappingjacksonvalue container.
write the actual json content to the stream.
filter out undesired attributes from the given model. the return value can be either another map or a single value object. the default implementation removes bindingresult instances and entries not included in the #setmodelkeys modelkeys property.
build a freemarker template model for the given model map. the default implementation builds a allhttpscopeshashmodel.
invoked on startup. looks for a single freemarkerconfig bean to find the relevant configuration for this factory. checks that the template for the default locale can be found: freemarker will check non-locale-specific templates if a locale-specific one is not found.

create a tiles request. this implementation creates a servletrequest.
creates and exposes a tilescontainer for this web application, delegating to the tilesinitializer.
specify whether to apply tiles 3.0's "complete-autoload" configuration. see org.apache.tiles.extras.complete.completeautoloadtilescontainerfactory for details on the complete-autoload mode. note: specifying the complete-autoload mode effectively disables all other bean properties on this configurer. the entire initialization procedure is then left to org.apache.tiles.extras.complete.completeautoloadtilesinitializer.
see scripttemplateconfigurer#setresourceloaderpath(string) documentation.
locate the object to be marshalled. the default implementation first attempts to look under the configured locate an object of marshaller#supports(class) supported type.
check whether the given value from the current view's model is eligible for marshalling through the configured marshaller. the default implementation calls marshaller#supports(class), unwrapping a given jaxbelement first if applicable.
convert the supplied object into an xslt source if the
close the underlying resource managed by the supplied source if applicable. only works for streamsource streamsources.
create the transformer instance used to prefer the xslt transformation. the default implementation simply calls templates#newtransformer(), and configures the transformer with the custom uriresolver if specified.
copy the configured output properties, if any, into the
instantiate a new transformerfactory for this view. the default implementation simply calls if a #settransformerfactoryclass "transformerfactoryclass" has been specified explicitly, the default constructor of the specified class will be called instead. can be overridden in subclasses.

register tiles 3.x view resolver. note that you must also configure tiles by adding a
register jsp view resolver with the specified prefix and suffix. when this method is invoked more than once, each call will register a new viewresolver instance. note that since it's not easy to determine if a jsp exists without forwarding to it, using multiple jsp-based view resolvers only makes sense in combination with the "viewnames" property on the resolver indicating which view names are handled by which resolver.

return all configured mappedinterceptor mappedinterceptors as an array.
update the handlerexecutionchain for cors-related handling. for pre-flight requests, the default implementation replaces the selected handler with a simple httprequesthandler that invokes the configured for actual requests, the default implementation inserts a handlerinterceptor that makes cors-related checks and adds cors headers.
set the "global" cors configurations based on url patterns. by default the first matching url pattern is combined with the cors configuration for the handler, if any.
build a handlerexecutionchain for the given handler, including applicable interceptors. the default implementation builds a standard handlerexecutionchain with the given handler, the handler mapping's common interceptors, and any are added in the order they were registered. subclasses may override this in order to extendrearrange the list of interceptors. note: the passed-in handler object may be a raw handler or a pre-built handlerexecutionchain. this method should handle those two cases explicitly, either building a new handlerexecutionchain or extending the existing chain. for simply adding an interceptor in a custom subclass, consider calling
return the adapted interceptors as handlerinterceptor array.
initialize the specified interceptors, checking for mappedinterceptor mappedinterceptors and adapting handlerinterceptors and webrequestinterceptor handlerinterceptors and
register all handlers found in the current applicationcontext. the actual url determination for a handler is up to the concrete which no such urls could be determined is simply not considered a handler.

create the handlermethod instance.
look up a handler method for the given request.
look for handler methods in the specified handler bean.
look up the best-matching handler method for the current request. if multiple matches are found, the best match is selected.

identifies invalid resource paths. by default rejects:  paths that contain "web-inf" or "meta-inf" paths that contain ".." after a call to paths that represent a org.springframework.util.resourceutils#isurl valid url or would represent one after the leading slash is removed.  note: this method assumes that leading, duplicate '' or control characters (e.g. white space) have been trimmed so that the path starts predictably with a single '' or does not have one.
processes a resource request. checks for the existence of the requested resource in the configured list of locations. if the resource does not exist, a 404 response will be returned to the client. if the resource exists, the request will be checked for the presence of the timestamp of the given resource, returning a 304 status code if the of the resource will be written to the response with caching headers set to expire one year in the future.
initialize the content negotiation strategy depending on the contentnegotiationmanager setup and the availability of a servletcontext.
find the resource under the given location. the default implementation checks if there is a readable
find a versionstrategy for the request path of the requested resource.
insert a fixed, prefix-based version in resource urls that match the given path patterns, for example: "versionjsmain.js". this is useful (vs. content-based versions) when using javascript module loaders. the version may be a random number, the current date, or a value fetched from a git commit sha, a property file, or environment variable and set with spel expressions in the configuration (e.g. see @value in java config). if not done already, variants of the given pathpatterns, prefixed with the version will be also configured. for example, adding a "js" path pattern will also cofigure automatically a "v1.0.0js" with "v1.0.0" the relative to the pattern configured with the resource handler
a transformer can use this method when a resource being transformed contains links to other resources. such links need to be replaced with the public facing link as determined by the resource resolver chain (e.g. the public url may have a version inserted).
transform the given relative request path to an absolute path, taking the path of the given request as a point of reference. the resulting path is also cleaned from sequences like "path..".
if the defaultservletname property has not been explicitly set, attempts to locate the default servlet using the known common container-specific names.
compare the given path against configured resource handler mappings and if a match is found use the resourceresolver chain of the matched public use. it is expected that the given path is what spring mvc would use for request mapping purposes, i.e. excluding context and servlet path portions. if several handler mappings match, the handler used will be the one configured with the most specific pattern.

convert the given routerfunction router function into a webhandler, using the given strategies.
route to the given router function if the given request predicate applies. this method can be used to create nested routes, where a group of routes share a common path (prefix), header, or other request predicate. for instance, the following example first creates a composed route that resolves to nested with a "user" path predicate, so that get requests for "user" will list users, and post request for "user" will create a new user.  class="code"> routerfunction<serverresponse> userroutes = routerfunctions.route(requestpredicates.method(httpmethod.get), this::listusers) .androute(requestpredicates.method(httpmethod.post), this::createuser); routerfunction<serverresponse> nestedroute = routerfunctions.nest(requestpredicates.path("user"), userroutes);

create a composite logger that delegates to a primary or falls back on a secondary logger if logging for the primary logger is not enabled. this may be used for fallback logging from lower level packages that logically should log together with some higher level package but the two don't happen to share a suitable parent package (e.g. logging for the web and lower level http and codec packages). for such cases the primary, class-based logger can be wrapped with a shared fallback logger.
create a new type descriptor from the given type. use this to instruct the conversion system to convert an object to a specific target type, when no type location such as a method parameter or field is available to provide additional conversion context. generally prefer use of #forobject(object) for constructing type descriptors from source objects, as it handles the null object case.
if this type is an array, returns the array's component type. if this type is a stream, returns the stream's component type. if this type is a collection and it is parameterized, returns the collection's element type. if the collection is not parameterized, returns null indicating the element type is not declared. collection but its element type is not parameterized
returns true if an object of this type descriptor can be assigned to the location described by the given type descriptor. for example, valueof(string.class).isassignableto(valueof(charsequence.class)) returns true because a string value can be assigned to a charsequence variable. on the other hand, valueof(number.class).isassignableto(valueof(integer.class)) returns false because, while all integers are numbers, not all numbers are integers. for arrays, collections, and maps, element and keyvalue types are checked if declared. for example, a list<string> field value is assignable to a collection<charsequence> field, but list<number> is not assignable to list<integer>. type descriptor

create a type descriptor for a nested type declared within the method parameter. for example, if the methodparameter is a list and the nesting level is 1, the nested type descriptor will be string.class. if the methodparameter is a list> and the nesting level is 2, the nested type descriptor will also be a string.class. if the methodparameter is a map string> and the nesting level is 1, the nested type descriptor will be string, derived from the map value. if the methodparameter is a list string>> and the nesting level is 2, the nested type descriptor will be string, derived from the map value. returns null if a nested type cannot be obtained because it was not declared. for example, if the method parameter is a list, the nested type descriptor returned will be null. map keyvalue declaration within the method parameter or null if it could not be obtained specified nesting level are not of collection, array, or map types
create a new type descriptor from a java.util.collection type. useful for converting to typed collections. for example, a list could be converted to a the method call to construct such a typedescriptor would look something like: collection(list.class, typedescriptor.valueof(emailaddress.class)); used to convert collection elements
create a new type descriptor from a resolvabletype. this constructor is used internally and may also be used by subclasses that support non-java languages with extended type systems. it is public as of 5.1.4 whereas it was protected before.
create a new type descriptor from a java.util.map type. useful for converting to typed maps. for example, a map<string, string> could be converted to a map<id, emailaddress> by converting to a targettype built with this method: the method call to construct such a typedescriptor would look something like:  class="code"> map(map.class, typedescriptor.valueof(id.class), typedescriptor.valueof(emailaddress.class)); 
narrows this typedescriptor by setting its type to the class of the provided value. if the value is null, no narrowing is performed and this typedescriptor is returned unchanged. designed to be called by binding frameworks when they read property, field, or method return values. allows such frameworks to narrow a typedescriptor built from a declared property, field, or method return value type. for example, a field declared as java.lang.object would be narrowed to java.util.hashmap if it was set to a java.util.hashmap value. the narrowed typedescriptor can then be used to convert the hashmap to some other type. annotation and nested type context is preserved by the narrowed copy. class of the provided value)
create a new type descriptor from a field. use this constructor when a source or target conversion point is a field.
create a new type descriptor from a property. use this constructor when a source or target conversion point is a property on a java class.

create a new, empty annotationattributes instance for the specified annotationtype.
return an annotationattributes instance based on the given map. if the map is already an annotationattributes instance, it will be cast and returned immediately without creating a new instance. otherwise a new instance will be created by passing the supplied map to the #annotationattributes(map) constructor.
enrich and validate the supplied attributes map by ensuring that it contains a non-null entry for each annotation attribute in the specified annotationtype and that the type of the entry matches the return type for the corresponding annotation attribute. if an entry is a map (presumably of annotation attributes), an attempt will be made to synthesize an annotation from it. similarly, if an entry is an array of maps, an attempt will be made to synthesize an array of annotations from those maps. if an attribute is missing in the supplied map, it will be set either to the value of its alias (if an alias exists) or to the value of the attribute's default value (if defined), and otherwise an illegalargumentexception will be thrown.

get a map of all attribute aliases declared via @aliasfor in the supplied annotation type. the map is keyed by attribute name with each value representing a list of names of aliased attributes. for explicit alias pairs such as x and y (i.e. where x is an @aliasfor("y") and y is an @aliasfor("x"), there will be two entries in the map: x -> (y) and y -> (x). for implicit aliases (i.e. attributes that are declared as attribute overrides for the same attribute in the same meta-annotation), there will be n entries in the map. for example, if x, y, and z are implicit aliases, the map will contain the following entries: an empty return value implies that the annotation does not declare any attribute aliases.
find a single annotation of annotationtype on the supplied annotatedelement. meta-annotations will be searched if the annotation is not directly present on the supplied element. warning: this method operates generically on annotated elements. in other words, this method does not execute specialized search algorithms for classes or methods. if you require the more specific semantics of #findannotation(class, class) or #findannotation(method, class), invoke one of those methods instead.

compare two patterns to determine which should match first, i.e. which is the most specific regarding the current path. more specific, equally specific, or less specific than pattern2.
build or retrieve an antpathstringmatcher for the given pattern. the default implementation checks this antpathmatcher's internal cache (see #setcachepatterns), creating a new antpathstringmatcher instance if no cached copy is found. when encountering too many patterns to cache at runtime (the threshold is 65536), it turns the default cache off, assuming that arbitrary permutations of patterns are coming in, with little chance for encountering a recurring pattern. this method may be overridden to implement a custom cache strategy.
given a pattern and a full path, determine the pattern-mapped part. for example:  ' docscvscommit.html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> '' ' docs' and ' docscvscommit -> ' cvscommit' ' docscvs.html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> ' commit.html' ' docs' and ' docscvscommit -> ' cvscommit' ' docs\.html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> ' cvscommit.html' ' .html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> ' docscvscommit.html' ' .html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> ' docscvscommit.html' ' ' and ' docscvscommit.html -> ' docscvscommit.html'  assumes that #match returns true for ' pattern' and ' path', but does not enforce this.
combine two patterns into a new pattern. this implementation simply concatenates the two patterns, unless the first pattern contains a file extension match (e.g., .html). in that case, the second pattern will be merged into the first. otherwise, an illegalargumentexception will be thrown. examples  border="1"> pattern 1pattern 2result  null null  hotels nullhotels  nullhotelshotels hotelsbookingshotelsbookings hotelsbookingshotelsbookings hotelsbookingshotelsbookings hotels**bookingshotels**bookings hotelshotelhotelshotel hotelshotelhotelshotel hotels**hotelhotels**hotel .htmlhotels.htmlhotels.html .htmlhotelshotels.html .html.txt illegalargumentexception

determine whether the given method explicitly declares the given exception or one of its superclasses, which means that an exception of that type can be propagated as-is within a reflective invocation.
get the unique set of declared methods on the leaf class and all superclasses. leaf class methods are included first and while traversing the superclass hierarchy any methods found with signatures matching a method already included are filtered out.
set the field represented by the supplied field field object on the specified object target object to the specified value. in accordance with field#set(object, object) semantics, the new value is automatically unwrapped if the underlying field has a primitive type. thrown exceptions are handled via a call to #handlereflectionexception(exception).
attempt to find a field field on the supplied class with the supplied name andor class type. searches all superclasses up to object.

make the given field accessible, explicitly setting it accessible if necessary. the setaccessible(true) method is only called when actually necessary, to avoid unnecessary conflicts with a jvm securitymanager (if active).
this variant retrieves class#getdeclaredmethods() from a local cache in order to avoid the jvm's securitymanager check and defensive array copying. in addition, it also includes java 8 default methods from locally implemented interfaces, since those are effectively to be treated just like declared methods.

create a new buffer and store it in the linkedlist adds a new buffer that can store at least mincapacity bytes.
update the message digest with the next len bytes in this stream. avoids creating new byte arrays and use internal buffers for performance.
convert the stream's data to a byte array and return the byte array. also replaces the internal structures with the byte array to conserve memory: if the byte array is being made anyways, mind as well as use it. this approach also means that if this method is called twice without any writes in between, the second call is a no-op. this method is "unsafe" as it returns the internal buffer. callers should not modify the returned buffer.

resolve the given class name into a class instance. supports primitives (like "int") and array class names (like "string[]"). this is effectively equivalent to the forname method with the same arguments, with the only difference being the exceptions thrown in case of class loading failure. (may be null, which indicates the default class loader) (that is, the class could not be found or the class file could not be loaded) there was a readability mismatch in the inheritance hierarchy of the class (typically a missing dependency declaration in a jigsaw module definition for a superclass or interface implemented by the class to be loaded here)
determine the name of the class file, relative to the containing package: e.g. "string.class"
given a method, which may come from an interface, and a target class used in the current reflective invocation, find the corresponding target method if there is one. e.g. the method may be ifoo.bar() and the target class may be defaultfoo. in this case, the method may be note: in contrast to org.springframework.aop.support.aoputils#getmostspecificmethod, this method does not resolve java 5 bridge methods automatically. call org.springframework.core.bridgemethodresolver#findbridgedmethod if bridge method resolution is desirable (e.g. for obtaining metadata from the original method definition). note: since spring 3.1.1, if java security settings disallow reflective access (e.g. calls to class#getdeclaredmethods etc, this implementation will fall back to returning the originally provided method. (may be null or may not even implement the method)
return a path suitable for use with classloader.getresource (also suitable for use with class.getresource by prepending a slash ('') to the return value). built by taking the package of the specified class file, converting all dots ('.') to slashes (''), adding a trailing slash if necessary, and concatenating the specified resource name to this. as such, this function may be used to build a path suitable for loading a resource file that is in the same package as a class file, although org.springframework.core.io.classpathresource is usually even more convenient.

(may be null, which indicates the default class loader)
determine whether the given class has a public method with the given signature, and return it if available (else throws an illegalstateexception). in case of any signature specified, only returns the method if there is a unique candidate, i.e. a single public method with the specified name. essentially translates nosuchmethodexception to illegalstateexception. (may be null to indicate any signature)
check whether the given class is visible in the given classloader. (may be null in which case this method will always return true)
given an input class object, return a string which consists of the class's package name as a pathname, i.e., all dots ('.') are replaced by slashes (''). neither a leading nor trailing slash is added. the result could be concatenated with a slash and the name of a resource and fed directly to classloader.getresource(). for it to be fed to to be prepended to the returned value. (empty) package will result in an empty string ("") being returned.
add given iterator to this composite.

(i.e. not a standard number subclass as included in the jdk)
parse the given text into a number instance of the given target class, using the supplied numberformat. trims the input string before attempting to parse the number. (i.e. not a standard number subclass as included in the jdk)
template method for the creation of a new thread. the default implementation creates a new thread for the given
algorithm that judges the match between the declared parameter types of a candidate method and a specific list of arguments that this method is supposed to be invoked with. determines a weight that represents the class hierarchy difference between types and arguments. a direct match, i.e. type integer -> arg of class integer, does not increase the result - all direct matches means weight 0. a match between type object and arg of class integer would increase the weight by 2, due to the superclass 2 steps up in the hierarchy (i.e. object) being the last one that still matches the required type object. type number and class integer would increase the weight by 1 accordingly, due to the superclass 1 step up the hierarchy (i.e. number) still matching the required type number. therefore, with an arg of type integer, a constructor (integer) would be preferred to a constructor (number) which would in turn be preferred to a constructor (object). all argument weights get accumulated. note: this is the algorithm used by methodinvoker itself and also the algorithm used for constructor and factory method selection in spring's bean container (in case of lenient constructor resolution which is the default for regular bean definitions).

add a "max-age=" directive. this directive is well suited for publicly caching resources, knowing that they won't change within the configured amount of time. additional directives can be also used, in case resources shouldn't be cached ( #cacheprivate()) or transformed ( #notransform()) by shared caches. in order to prevent caches to reuse the cached response even when it has become stale (i.e. the "max-age" delay is passed), the "must-revalidate" directive should be set ( #mustrevalidate()
add a "no-store" directive. this directive is well suited for preventing caches (browsers and proxies) to cache the content of responses.
add a "no-cache" directive. this directive is well suited for telling caches that the response can be reused only if the client revalidates it with the server. this directive won't disable cache altogether and may result with clients sending conditional requests (with "etag", "if-modified-since" headers) and the server responding with "304 - not modified" status. in order to disable caching and minimize requestsresponses exchanges, the #nostore() directive should be used instead of #nocache().
return the "cache-control" header value.

delegate the servletcontext to any webapplicationinitializer implementations present on the application classpath. because this class declares @ handlestypes(webapplicationinitializer.class), servlet 3.0+ containers will automatically scan the classpath for implementations of spring's webapplicationinitializer interface and provide the set of all such types to the webappinitializerclasses parameter of this method. if no webapplicationinitializer implementations are found on the classpath, this method is effectively a no-op. an info-level log message will be issued notifying the user that the servletcontainerinitializer has indeed been invoked but that no webapplicationinitializer implementations were found. assuming that one or more webapplicationinitializer types are detected, they will be instantiated (and sorted if the @ org.springframework.core.annotation.order @order annotation is present or the org.springframework.core.ordered ordered interface has been implemented). then the webapplicationinitializer#onstartup(servletcontext) method will be invoked on each instance, delegating the servletcontext such that each instance may register and configure servlets such as spring's or any other servlet api componentry such as filters.

if the provided instance contains a bean name rather than an object instance, the bean name is resolved before a handlermethod is created and returned.
assert that the target bean class is an instance of the class where the given method is declared. in some cases the actual controller instance at request- processing time may be a jdk dynamic proxy (lazy initialization, prototype beans, and others). @controller's that require proxying should prefer class-based proxy mechanisms.

construct a new attribute instance with the given constructor. called from after constructor resolution.
determine any validation triggered by the given annotation. or null if this annotation does not trigger any validation

returns true if the parameter is annotated with method parameter that is not a simple type.
validate the model attribute if applicable. the default implementation checks for @javax.validation.valid, spring's org.springframework.validation.annotation.validated, and custom annotations whose name starts with "valid".
add non-null return values to the modelandviewcontainer.
whether to raise a fatal bind exception on validation errors.
return true if there is a method-level @modelattribute or, in default resolution mode, for any return value type that is not a simple type.
extension point to create the model attribute if not found in the model, with subsequent parameter binding through bean properties (unless suppressed). the default implementation typically uses the unique public no-arg constructor if available but also handles a "primary constructor" approach for data classes: it understands the javabeans constructorproperties annotation as well as runtime-retained parameter names in the bytecode, associating request parameters with constructor arguments by name. if no such constructor is found, the default constructor will be used (even if not public), assuming subsequent bean property bindings through setter methods.
resolve the argument from the model or if not found instantiate it with its default if it is available. the model attribute is then populated with request values via data binding and optionally validated if @java.validation.valid is present on the argument. and the next method parameter is not of type errors
supports the following:  @requestparam-annotated method arguments. this excludes map params where the annotation does not specify a name. see requestparammapmethodargumentresolver instead for such params. arguments of type multipartfile unless annotated with @ requestpart. arguments of type part unless annotated with @ requestpart. in default resolution mode, simple type arguments even if not with @ requestparam.

resolve the given annotation-specified value, potentially containing placeholders and expressions.
create a new requestpartservletserverhttprequest instance.
look for a multipartresolver bean in the root web application context. supports a "multipartresolverbeanname" filter init param; the default bean name is "filtermultipartresolver". this can be overridden to use a custom multipartresolver instance, for example if not using a spring web application context.
check for a multipart request via this filter's multipartresolver, and wrap the original request with a multiparthttpservletrequest if appropriate. all later elements in the filter chain, most importantly servlets, benefit from proper parameter extraction in the multipart case, and are able to cast to multiparthttpservletrequest if they need to.
determine the encoding for the given request. can be overridden in subclasses. the default implementation checks the request encoding, falling back to the default encoding specified for this resolver.
parse the given servlet request, resolving its multipart elements.
set the temporary directory where uploaded files get stored. default is the servlet container's temporary directory for the web application.
parse the given list of commons fileitems into a spring multipartparsingresult, containing spring multipartfile instances and a map of multipart parameter.
cleanup the spring multipartfiles created during multipart parsing, potentially holding temporary data on disk. deletes the underlying commons fileitem instances.

create a commonsmultipartfile wrapper for the given commons fileitem.
find the root webapplicationcontext for this web app, typically loaded via org.springframework.web.context.contextloaderlistener. will rethrow an exception that happened on root context startup, to differentiate between a failed context startup and no context at all.
return the best available mutex for the given session: that is, an object to synchronize on for the given session. returns the session mutex attribute if available; usually, this means that the httpsessionmutexlistener needs to be defined in web.xml. falls back to the session reference itself if no mutex attribute found. the session mutex is guaranteed to be the same object during the entire lifetime of the session, available under the key defined by the session_mutex_attribute constant. it serves as a safe reference to synchronize on for locking on the current session. in many cases, the session reference itself is a safe mutex as well, since it will always be the same object reference for the same active logical session. however, this is not guaranteed across different servlet containers; the only 100% safe way is a session mutex.
find the root webapplicationcontext for this web app, typically loaded via org.springframework.web.context.contextloaderlistener. will rethrow an exception that happened on root context startup, to differentiate between a failed context startup and no context at all.
handle the navigation request implied by the specified parameters, through delegating to the target bean in the spring application context. the target bean needs to extend the jsf navigationhandler class. if it extends spring's decoratingnavigationhandler, the overloaded as argument will be used. else, the standard handlenavigation method will be called.
method to be called by subclasses when intending to delegate to the next handler in the navigationhandler chain. will always call the most appropriate next handler, either the decorated navigationhandler passed in as constructor argument or the original navigationhandler as passed into this method - according to the position of this instance in the chain. will call the decorated navigationhandler specified as constructor argument, if any. in case of a decoratingnavigationhandler as target, the original navigationhandler as passed into this method will be passed on to the next element in the chain: this ensures propagation of the original handler that the last element in the handler chain might delegate back to. in case of a standard navigationhandler as target, the original handler will simply not get passed on; no delegating back to the original is possible further down the chain in that scenario. if no decorated navigationhandler specified as constructor argument, this instance is the last element in the chain. hence, this method will call the original navigationhandler as passed into this method. if no original navigationhandler has been passed in (for example if this instance is the last element in a chain with standard navigationhandlers as earlier elements), this method corresponds to a no-op. specified outcome, or null if the outcome was acquired by some other means (which may be null) or null if none
check the given property values for field markers, i.e. for fields that start with the field marker prefix. the existence of a field marker indicates that the specified field existed in the form. if the property values do not contain a corresponding field value, the field will be considered as empty and will be reset appropriately.
determine an empty value for the specified field. the default implementation returns:   boolean.false for boolean fields an empty array for array types collection implementations for collection types map implementations for map types else, null is used as default 
check the given property values for field defaults, i.e. for fields that start with the field default prefix. the existence of a field defaults indicates that the specified value should be used if the field is otherwise not present.
bind all multipart files contained in the given request, if any (in case of a multipart request). to be called by subclasses. multipart files will only be added to the property values if they are not empty or if we're configured to bind empty multipart files too.

bind the parameters of the given request to this binder's target, also binding multipart files in case of a multipart request. this call can create field errors, representing basic binding errors like a required field (code "required"), or type mismatch between value and bean property (code "typemismatch"). multipart files are bound via their parameter name, just like normal http parameters: i.e. "uploadedfile" to an "uploadedfile" bean property, invoking a "setuploadedfile" setter method. the type of the target property for a multipart file can be multipartfile, byte[], or string. the latter two receive the contents of the uploaded file; all metadata like original file name, content type, etc are lost in those cases.

standard way of initializing this filter. map config parameters onto bean properties of this filter, and invoke subclass initialization. properties are missing), or if subclass initialization fails.
create new filterconfigpropertyvalues. we can't accept default values
this dofilter implementation stores a request attribute for "already filtered", proceeding without filtering again if the attribute is already there.
return the webapplicationcontext passed in at construction time, if available. otherwise, attempt to retrieve a webapplicationcontext from the configured name if set. otherwise look up a webapplicationcontext under the well-known "root" application context attribute. the subclasses may override this method to provide a different
actually invoke the delegate filter with the given request and response.
destroy the filter delegate. default implementation simply calls filter.destroy on it.
initialize the filter delegate, defined as bean the given spring application context. the default implementation fetches the bean from the application context and calls the standard filter.init method on it, passing in the filterconfig of this filter proxy.
clean up all the filters supplied, calling each one's destroy method in turn, but in reverse order.
forms a temporary chain from the list of delegate filters supplied ( #setfilters) and executes them in order. each filter delegates to the next one in the list, achieving the normal behavior of a filterchain, despite the fact that this is a filter.

indicates whether the given request and response are eligible for etag generation. the default implementation returns true if all conditions match:  response status codes in the 2xx series request method is a get response cache-control header is not set or does not contain a "no-store" directive 
generate the etag header value from the given response body byte array. the default implementation generates an md5 hash.
constructor with required information. may change during a forward (e.g. tomcat.
create a log message for the given request, prefix and suffix. if includequerystring is true, then the inner part of the log message will take the form request_uri?query_string; otherwise the message will simply be of the form request_uri. the final message is composed of the inner part as described and the supplied prefix and suffix.

remove nested "" such as in uri vars with regular expressions.
return an appropriate response object of the specified type, if available, unwrapping the given response as far as necessary. of that type is available
check the given request origin against a list of allowed origins. a list containing "" means that all origins are allowed. an empty list means only same origin is allowed. note: as of 5.1 this method ignores client-originated address. consider using the forwardedheaderfilter to extract and use, or to discard such headers.
return whether default html escaping is enabled for the web application, i.e. the value of the "defaulthtmlescape" context-param in web.xml (if any). this method differentiates between no param specified at all and an actual boolean value specified, allowing to have a context-specific default in case of no setting at the global level. ( null = no explicit default)
return the best available mutex for the given session: that is, an object to synchronize on for the given session. returns the session mutex attribute if available; usually, this means that the httpsessionmutexlistener needs to be defined in web.xml. falls back to the httpsession itself if no mutex attribute found. the session mutex is guaranteed to be the same object during the entire lifetime of the session, available under the key defined by the session_mutex_attribute constant. it serves as a safe reference to synchronize on for locking on the current session. in many cases, the httpsession reference itself is a safe mutex as well, since it will always be the same object reference for the same active logical session. however, this is not guaranteed across different servlet containers; the only 100% safe way is a session mutex.
return whether response encoding should be used when html escaping characters, thus only escaping xml markup significant characters with utf- encodings. this option is enabled for the web application with a servletcontext param, i.e. the value of the "responseencodedhtmlescape" context-param in web.xml (if any). this method differentiates between no param specified at all and an actual boolean value specified, allowing to have a context-specific default in case of no setting at the global level. ( null = no explicit default)
return an appropriate request object of the specified type, if available, unwrapping the given request as far as necessary. of that type is available
clear the servlet spec's error attributes as javax.servlet.http.httpservletrequest attributes under the keys defined in the servlet 2.3 specification:
return a map containing all parameters with the given prefix. maps single values to string and multiple values to string array. for example, with a prefix of "spring_", "spring_param1" and "spring_param2" result in a map with "param1" and "param2" as keys. (if this is null or the empty string, all parameters will match) containing either a string or a string array as values

determine the session id of the given request, if any.
check the given request for a session attribute of the given name. returns null if there is no session or if the session has no such attribute. does not create a new session if none has existed before!
check the given request for a session attribute of the given name. throws an exception if there is no session or if the session has no such attribute. does not create a new session if none has existed before!
return the real path of the given path within the web application, as provided by the servlet container. prepends a slash if the path does not already start with a slash, and throws a filenotfoundexception if the path cannot be resolved to a resource (in contrast to servletcontext's getrealpath, which returns null).
expose the specified request attribute if not already present.
set the session attribute with the given name to the given value. removes the session attribute if value is null, if a session existed at all. does not create a new session if not necessary!
remove the system property that points to the web app root directory. to be called on shutdown of the web application.
check if the request is a same-origin one, based on origin, host, note: as of 5.1 this method ignores client-originated address. consider using the forwardedheaderfilter to extract and use, or to discard such headers. of cross-origin request
check if a specific input type="submit" parameter was sent in the request, either via a button (directly with name) or via an image (name + ".x" or name + ".y").
set a system property to the web application root directory. the key of the system property can be defined with the "webapprootkey" context-param in web.xml. default is "webapp.root". can be used for tools that support substitution with system.getproperty values, like log4j's "$key" syntax within log file locations. or if the war file is not expanded
obtain a named parameter from the given request parameters. this method will try to obtain a parameter value using the following algorithm:  try to get the parameter value using just the given logical name. this handles parameters of the form logicalname = value. for normal parameters, e.g. submitted using a hidden html form field, this will return the requested value. try to obtain the parameter value from the parameter name, where the parameter name in the request is of the form logicalname_value = xyz with "_" being the configured delimiter. this deals with parameter values submitted using an html form submit button. if the value obtained in the previous step has a ".x" or ".y" suffix, remove that. this handles cases where the value was submitted using an html form image button. in this case the parameter in the request would actually be of the form logicalname_value.x = 123.   if the parameter does not exist in given request
parse the given string with matrix variables. an example string would look like this "q1=a;q1=b;q2=a,b,c". the resulting map would contain keys "q1" and "q2" with values ["a","b"] and
copy the cached body content to the response. for the complete cached body content

encode the given source into an encoded string using the rules specified by the given component and with the given options.
create a uricomponentsbuilder from the uri template string. this implementation also breaks up the path into path segments depending on whether #setparsepath parsepath is enabled.
determine whether the supplied tag has any ancestor tag of the supplied type. of the supplied type or if the supplied ancestortagclass is not type-assignable to the tag class
determine whether the supplied tag has any ancestor tag of the supplied type, throwing an illegalstateexception if not. have a tag of the supplied parenttagclass as an ancestor or in the case of the string-typed arguments, is composed wholly of whitespace; or if the supplied ancestortagclass is not type-assignable to the tag class
determines the scope for a given input string. if the string does not match 'request', 'session', 'page' or 'application', the method will return pagecontext#page_scope.
convenience method to apply #encode(string, charset) to all given uri variable values.
extract the file extension from the given uri path.
resolve $... placeholders in the given text, replacing them with corresponding servlet context init parameter or system property values. unresolvable placeholders with no default value are ignored and passed through unchanged if the flag is set to true.

return the servlet path for the given request, detecting an include request url if called within a requestdispatcher include.
sanitize the given path. uses the following rules:  replace all "" by "" 
return the path within the servlet mapping for the given request, i.e. the part of the request's url beyond the part that called the servlet, or "" if the whole url has been used to identify the servlet. detects include request url if called within a requestdispatcher include. e.g.: servlet mapping = ""; request uri = "testa" -> "testa". e.g.: servlet mapping = ""; request uri = "testa" -> "testa". e.g.: servlet mapping = "test"; request uri = "testa" -> "a". e.g.: servlet mapping = "test"; request uri = "test" -> "". e.g.: servlet mapping = ".test"; request uri = "a.test" -> "".
return the context path for the given request, detecting an include request url if called within a requestdispatcher include. as the value returned by request.getcontextpath() is not decoded by the servlet container, this method will decode it.
decode the given matrix variables via assumed the url path from which the variables were extracted is already decoded through a call to
return the request uri for the given request, detecting an include request url if called within a requestdispatcher include. as the value returned by request.getrequesturi() is not decoded by the servlet container, this method will decode it. the uri that the web container resolves should be correct, but some containers like jbossjetty incorrectly include ";" strings like ";jsessionid" in the uri. this method cuts off such incorrect appendices.
return the context path for the given request, detecting an include request url if called within a requestdispatcher include. as the value returned by request.getcontextpath() is not decoded by the servlet container, this method will decode it.
decode the given uri path variables via assumed the url path from which the variables were extracted is already decoded through a call to
determine the encoding for the given request. can be overridden in subclasses. the default implementation checks the request encoding, falling back to the default encoding specified for this resolver.
return the request uri for the given request. if this is a forwarded request, correctly resolves to the request uri of the original request.
match the given "mapping" to the start of the "requesturi" and if there is a match return the extra part. this method is needed because the context path and the servlet path returned by the httpservletrequest are stripped of semicolon content unlike the requesuri.
return the servlet path for the given request, regarding an include request url if called within a requestdispatcher include. as the value returned by request.getservletpath() is already decoded by the servlet container, this method will not attempt to decode it.
create a uri components builder from the given http url string. note: the presence of reserved characters can prevent correct parsing of the uri string. for example if a query parameter contains '=' or  characters, the query string cannot be parsed unambiguously. such values should be substituted for uri variables to enable correct parsing:  class="code"> string urlstring = "https:example.comhotels42?filter=value"; uricomponentsbuilder.fromhttpurl(urlstring).buildandexpand("hot&cold"); 
create a builder that is initialized with the given uri.

initialize components of this builder from components of the given uri.
set the path of this builder overriding all existing path and path segment values.
create a builder that is initialized with the given path.
append the given query to the existing query of this builder. the given query may contain uri template variables. note: the presence of reserved characters can prevent correct parsing of the uri string. for example if a query parameter contains '=' or  characters, the query string cannot be parsed unambiguously. such values should be substituted for uri variables to enable correct parsing:  class="code"> uricomponentsbuilder.fromuristring("hotels42") .query("filter=value") .buildandexpand("hot&cold"); 
create a builder that is initialized with the given uri string. note: the presence of reserved characters can prevent correct parsing of the uri string. for example if a query parameter contains '=' or  characters, the query string cannot be parsed unambiguously. such values should be substituted for uri variables to enable correct parsing:  class="code"> string uristring = "hotels42?filter=value"; uricomponentsbuilder.fromuristring(uristring).buildandexpand("hot&cold"); 
create an instance by parsing the "origin" header of an http request.
append the given query parameter to the existing query parameters. the given name or any of the values may contain uri template variables. if no values are given, the resulting uri will contain the query parameter name only (i.e. ?foo instead of ?foo=bar).
set or append individual uri components of this builder from the values of the given uricomponents instance. for the semantics of each component (i.e. set vs append) check the builder methods on this class. for example #host(string) sets while #path(string) appends.
insert a base url (if configured) unless the given url has a host already.
turn special characters into html character references. handles complete character set defined in html 4.01 recommendation. escapes all special characters to their corresponding numeric reference in hex format (&#xhex;) at least as required by the specified encoding. in other words, if a special character does not have to be escaped for the given encoding, it may not be. reference:  href="http:www.w3.orgtrhtml4sgmlentities.html"> http:www.w3.orgtrhtml4sgmlentities.html

return the reference mapped to the given character, or null if none found.
returns a new set of character entity references reflecting the html 4.0 character set.
turn javascript special characters into escaped characters.
matching a separator is easy, basically the character at candidateindex must be the separator.
matching on a wildcardpathelement is quite straight forward. scan the candidate from the candidateindex onwards for the next separator or the end of the candidate.

record a new captured variable. if it clashes with an existing one then report an error.
package private delegate for pathpatternparser#parse(string).
push a path element to the chain being build.
just hit a ':' and want to jump over the regex specification for this variable. pos will be pointing at the ':', we want to skip until the .  nested ... pairs don't have to be escaped: abcvar:x1,2def an escaped will not be treated as the end of the regex: abcvar:x\\y:def a separator that should not indicate the end of the regex can be escaped:
create a new capturevariablepathelement instance.
match the beginning of the given path and return the remaining portion not covered by this pattern. this is useful for matching nested routes where the path is matched incrementally at each level.
whether this pattern matches the given path.
return the string form of the pattern built from walking the path element chain.
match this pattern to the given uri path and return extracted uri template variables as well as path parameters (matrix variables).
determine the pattern-mapped part for the given path. for example:  ' docscvscommit.html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> '' ' docs' and ' docscvscommit' -> ' cvscommit' ' docscvs.html' and ' docscvscommit.html -> ' commit.html' ' docs' and ' docscvscommit -> ' cvscommit'  notes:  assumes that #matches returns true for the same path but does not enforce this. duplicate occurrences of separators within the returned result are removed leading and trailing separators are removed from the returned result  of it is matched by pattern elements
join two paths together including a separator if necessary. extraneous separators are removed (if the first path ends with one and the second path starts with one).
combine this pattern with another. currently does not produce a new pathpattern, just produces a new string.
compare this pattern with a supplied pattern: return -1,0,+1 if this pattern is more specific, the same or less specific than the supplied pattern. the aim is to sort more specific patterns first.
return a detailed message that includes the original pattern text with a pointer to the error position, as well as the error message.
calculate the full endpoint address for the given endpoint.
create a jax-ws service according to the parameters of this factory.
allow map access to the custom properties to be set on the stub, with the option to add or override specific entries. useful for specifying entries directly, for example via "customproperties[mykey]". this is particularly useful for adding or overriding entries in child bean definitions.
initialize the jax-ws port for this interceptor.
initialize this client interceptor's properties from the given webservice annotation, if necessary and possible (i.e. if "wsdldocumenturl", "namespaceuri", "servicename" and "portname" haven't been set but corresponding values are declared at the annotation level of the specified service interface).

register beans that are configured for lazy initialization with the with the mbeanserver
if the supplied managed resource implements the notificationpublisheraware an instance of
set the notificationlistener notificationlisteners to register with the javax.management.mbeanserver. the key of each entry in the map is a string representation of the javax.management.objectname or the bean name of the mbean the listener should be registered for. specifying an asterisk ( ) for a key will cause the listener to be associated with all mbeans registered by this class at startup time. the value of each entry is the advanced options such as registering handback objects see #setnotificationlisteners(notificationlistenerbean[]).
register the defined beans with the mbeanserver. each bean is exposed to the mbeanserver via a the modelmbeanprovider interface that is configured. by default the requiredmodelmbean class that is supplied with all jmx implementations is used. the management interface produced for each bean is dependent on the implementation of the objectnamingstrategy interface being used.
indicates whether or not a particular bean name is present in the excluded beans list.

iterate through all methods on the mbean class and gives subclasses the chance to vote on their inclusion. if a particular method corresponds to the accessor or mutator of an attribute that is included in the management interface, then the corresponding operation is exposed with the "role" descriptor field set to the appropriate value. of the mbeanexporter
iterate through all properties on the mbean class and gives subclasses the chance to vote on the inclusion of both the accessor and mutator. if a particular accessor or mutator is voted for inclusion, the appropriate metadata is assembled and passed to the subclass for descriptor population. of the mbeanexporter
apply the given jmx "currencytimelimit" value to the given descriptor. the default implementation sets a value >0 as-is (as number of cache seconds), turns a value of 0 into integer.max_value ("always cache") and sets the "defaultcurrencytimelimit" (if any, indicating "never cache") in case of a value <0. this follows the recommendation in the jmx 1.2 specification.
create an instance of the modelmbeaninfosupport class supplied with all jmx implementations and populates the metadata through calls to the subclass.

actually set the nested path. delegated to by setnestedpath and pushnestedpath.
check whether the given fielderror matches the given field.
transform the given field into its full path, regarding the nested path of this instance.
unwrap the source behind this error: possibly an exception (typically org.springframework.beans.propertyaccessexception) or a bean validation javax.validation.constraintviolation. the cause of the outermost exception will be introspected as well, e.g. the underlying conversion exception or exception thrown from a setter (instead of having to unwrap the propertyaccessexception in turn). (i.e. none specified or not available anymore after deserialization)
preserve the source behind this error: possibly an exception (typically org.springframework.beans.propertyaccessexception) or a bean validation javax.validation.constraintviolation. note that any such source object is being stored as transient: that is, it won't be part of a serialized error representation.

reject the given field with the given error code, error arguments and default message if the value is empty or just contains whitespace. an 'empty' value in this context means either null, the empty string "", or consisting wholly of whitespace. the object whose field is being validated does not need to be passed in because the errors instance can resolve field values by itself (it will usually hold an internal reference to the target object). (can be null)
reject the given field with the given error code, error arguments and default message if the value is empty. an 'empty' value in this context means either null or the empty string "". the object whose field is being validated does not need to be passed in because the errors instance can resolve field values by itself (it will usually hold an internal reference to the target object).

invoke the specified validators, if any, with the given validation hints. note: validation hints may get ignored by the actual target validator.
register fields that are required for each binding process. if one of the specified fields is not contained in the list of incoming property values, a corresponding "missing field" error will be created, with error code "required" (by the default binding error processor).
bind the given property values to this binder's target. this call can create field errors, representing basic binding errors like a required field (code "required"), or type mismatch between value and bean property (code "typemismatch"). note that the given propertyvalues should be a throwaway instance: for efficiency, it will be modified to just contain allowed fields if it implements the mutablepropertyvalues interface; else, an internal mutable copy will be created for this purpose. pass in a copy of the propertyvalues if you want your original instance to stay unmodified in any case.
return a model map for the obtained state, exposing an errors instance as ' #model_key_prefix model_key_prefix + objectname' and the object itself. note that the map is constructed every time you're calling this method. adding things to the map and then re-calling this method will not work. the attributes in the model map returned by this method are usually included in the modelandview for a form view that uses spring's bind tag, which needs access to the errors instance.

create a refreshable proxy for the given aop targetsource. indicate proxying of all interfaces implemented by the target class)
convert the given script source locator to a scriptsource instance. by default, supported locators are spring resource locations (such as "file:c:myscript.bsh" or "classpath:mypackagemyscript.bsh") and inline scripts ("inline:myscripttext...").
get the refresh check delay for the given scriptfactory beandefinition. if the beandefinition has a under the key #refresh_check_delay_attribute which is a valid number type, then this value is used. otherwise, the #defaultrefreshcheckdelay value is used.

exposes the exporter's service interface, if any, as target interface.
wrap the given arbitrary exception that happened during remote access in either a remoteexception or a spring remoteaccessexception (if the method signature does not support remoteexception). only call this for remote access exceptions, not for exceptions thrown by the target service itself! remoteaccessexception or remoteexception remoteexception
determine whether the given rmi exception indicates a connect failure. treats rmi's connectexception, connectioexception, unknownhostexception, nosuchobjectexception and stubnotfoundexception as connect failure.
perform a raw method invocation on the given rmi stub, letting reflection exceptions through as-is.
convert the given remoteexception that happened during remote access to spring's remoteaccessexception if the method signature does not support remoteexception. else, return the original remoteexception. a connect failure
determine the object to export: either the service object itself or a rmiinvocationwrapper in case of a non-rmi service object.

create a new remoteinvocation for the given aop method invocation.
perform this invocation on the given target object. typically called when a remoteinvocation is received on the server.
add an additional invocation attribute. useful to add additional invocation context without having to subclass remoteinvocation. attribute keys have to be unique, and no overriding of existing attributes is allowed. the implementation avoids to unnecessarily create the attributes map, to minimize serialization size.
fill the current client-side stack trace into the given exception. the given exception is typically thrown on the server and serialized as-is, with the client wanting it to contain the client-side portion of the stack trace as well. what we can do here is to update the trace, provided that we run on jdk 1.4+.
check whether a service reference has been set, and whether it matches the specified service.
get a proxy for the given service object, implementing the specified service interface. used to export a proxy that does not expose any internals but just a specific interface intended for remote access. furthermore, a

invoke the event listener method with the given argument values.
process the specified applicationevent, checking if the condition match and handling non-null result, if any.
assert that the target bean class is an instance of the class where the given method is declared. in some cases the actual bean instance at event- processing time may be a jdk dynamic proxy (lazy initialization, prototype beans, and others). event listener beans that require proxying should prefer class-based proxy mechanisms.
resolve the method arguments to use for the specified applicationevent. these arguments will be used to invoke the method handled by this instance. can return null to indicate that no suitable arguments could be resolved and therefore the method should not be invoked at all for the specified event.
invoke the given listener with the given event.
actually process the event, after having filtered according to the desired event source already. the default implementation invokes the specified delegate, if any.
create a sourcefilteringlistener for the given event source. only processing events from this source from the specified source

resolves the given message code as key in the retrieved bundle files, returning the value found in the bundle as-is (without messageformat parsing).
get a propertiesholder that contains the actually visible properties for a locale, after merging all specified resource bundles. either fetches the holder from the cache or freshly loads it. only used when caching resource bundle contents forever, i.e. with cacheseconds  0. therefore, merged properties are always cached forever.

return a messageformat for the given bundle and code, fetching already generated messageformats from the cache. defined for the given code
efficiently retrieve the string value for the specified key, or return null if not found. as of 4.2, the default implementation checks containskey before it attempts to call getstring (which would require catching missingresourceexception for key not found). can be overridden in subclasses.
return a resourcebundle for the given basename and code, fetching already generated messageformats from the cache. found for the given basename and locale
implemented for compatibility with
visit each bean definition in the given bean factory and attempt to replace $... property placeholders with values from the given properties.
processing occurs by replacing $... placeholders in bean definitions by resolving each against this configurer's set of propertysources, which includes:  all org.springframework.core.env.configurableenvironment#getpropertysources environment property sources, if an environment #setenvironment is present  #mergeproperties merged local properties, if #setlocation any any property sources set by calling #setpropertysources  if #setpropertysources is called, environment and local properties will be ignored. this method is designed to give the user fine-grained control over property sources, and once set, the configurer makes no assumptions about adding additional sources.

prepare this context for refreshing, setting its startup date and active flag as well as performing any initialization of property sources.
actually performs context closing: publishes a contextclosedevent and destroys the singletons in the bean factory of this application context. called by both close() and a jvm shutdown hook, if any.
assert that this context's beanfactory is currently active, throwing an illegalstateexception if it isn't. invoked by all beanfactory delegation methods that depend on an active context, i.e. in particular all bean accessor methods. the default implementation checks the #isactive() 'active' status of this context overall. may be overridden for more specific checks, or for a no-op if #getbeanfactory() itself throws an exception in such a case.
register the given beanpostprocessor beans.
invoke the given beanfactorypostprocessor beans.
invoke the given beandefinitionregistrypostprocessor beans.
register a bean from the given bean class, using the given supplier for obtaining a new instance (typically declared as a lambda expression or method reference), optionally customizing its bean definition metadata (again typically declared as a lambda expression or method reference). this method can be overridden to adapt the registration mechanism for all registerbean methods (since they all delegate to this one). of null, resolving a public constructor to be autowired instead)
do nothing: we hold a single internal beanfactory and rely on callers to register beans through our public methods (or the beanfactory's).
set the config locations for this application context. if not set, the implementation may use a default as appropriate.
load bean definitions from the given xml resources. loading each specified resource name
get a default message for the given messagesourceresolvable. this implementation fully renders the default message if available, or just returns the plain default message string if the primary message code is being used as a default message.
subclasses can override this method to resolve a message without arguments in an optimized fashion, i.e. to resolve without involving a messageformat. the default implementation does use messageformat, through delegating to the #resolvecode method. subclasses are encouraged to replace this with optimized resolution. unfortunately, java.text.messageformat is not implemented in an efficient fashion. in particular, it does not detect that a message pattern doesn't contain argument placeholders in the first place. therefore, it is advisable to circumvent messageformat for messages without arguments. (subclasses are encouraged to support internationalization)
try to retrieve the given message from the parent messagesource, if any. within the message
searches through the given array of objects, finds any messagesourceresolvable objects and resolves them. allows for messages to have messagesourceresolvables as arguments.

find all applicable applicationcontexts for the current application. called if no specific applicationcontext has been set for this livebeansview.
actually generate a json snapshot of the beans in the given applicationcontexts. this implementation doesn't use any json parsing libraries in order to avoid third-party library dependencies. it produces an array of context description objects, each containing a context and parent attribute as well as a beans attribute with nested bean description objects. each bean object contains a bean, scope, type and resource attribute, as well as a dependencies attribute with a nested array of bean names that the present bean depends on.
determine a resource description for the given bean definition and apply basic json escaping (backslashes, double quotes) to it.

factory method to obtain a sourceclass from a class.
factory method to obtain sourceclass sourceclasss from class names.
factory method to obtain a sourceclass from a class name.
recursively collect all declared @import values. unlike most meta-annotations it is valid to have several @imports declared with different values; the usual process of returning values from the first meta-annotation on a class is not sufficient. for example, it is common for a @configuration class to declare direct annotation.
register default methods on interfaces implemented by the configuration class.
retrieve the metadata for all @bean methods.
handle the specified deferredimportselector. if deferred import selectors are being collected, this registers this instance to the list. if they are being processed, the deferredimportselector is also processed immediately according to its deferredimportselector.group.

factory method to obtain a sourceclass from a configurationclass.
create a new configurationclassparser instance that will be used to populate the set of configuration classes.

apply further settings to the given bean definition, beyond the contents retrieved from scanning the component class.
check the given candidate's bean name, determining whether the corresponding bean definition needs to be registered or conflicts with an existing definition. existing, compatible bean definition for the specified name bean definition has been found for the specified name

determine whether the given class is a candidate component based on any
determine whether the given bean definition qualifies as candidate. the default implementation checks whether the class is not an interface and not dependent on an enclosing class. can be overridden in subclasses.

return the metadatareaderfactory used by this component provider.
determine if the specified include typefilter is supported by the index.
check whether the given annotation is a stereotype that is allowed to suggest a component name through its annotation value().
derive a bean name from one of the annotations on the class.
derive a default bean name from the given bean definition. the default implementation simply builds a decapitalized version of the short class name: e.g. "mypackage.myjdbcdao" -> "myjdbcdao". note that inner classes will thus have names of the form "outerclassname.innerclassname", which because of the period in the name may be an issue if you are autowiring by name.

create a new scannedgenericbeandefinition for the class that the given metadatareader describes.
register, escalate, and configure the standard auto proxy creator (apc) against the given registry. works by finding the nearest annotation declared on the importing attributes. if mode is set to proxy, the apc is registered; if subclass (cglib) proxying. several @enable annotations expose both mode and capabilities end up sharing a aopconfigutils#auto_proxy_creator_bean_name single apc. for this reason, this implementation doesn't "care" exactly which annotation it finds -- as long as it exposes the right mode and the same.
create a new annotatedbeandefinitionreader for the given registry and using the given environment. in the form of a beandefinitionregistry profiles.
register a bean from the given bean class, deriving its metadata from class-declared annotations. (may be null) in addition to qualifiers at the bean class level factory's beandefinition, e.g. setting a lazy-init or primary flag

loads the specified class and generates a cglib subclass of it equipped with container-aware callbacks capable of respecting scoping and other bean semantics.
create a subclass proxy that intercepts calls to getobject(), delegating to the current beanfactory instead of creating a new instance. these proxies are created only when calling a factorybean from within a bean method, allowing for proper scoping semantics even when working against the factorybean instance directly. if a factorybean instance is fetched through the container via  it will not be proxied. this too is aligned with the way xml configuration works.
creates a new cglib enhancer instance.

create a messagesource for the given basename, to be used as messagesource for the corresponding theme. default implementation creates a resourcebundlemessagesource. for the given basename. a subclass could create a specifically configured reloadableresourcebundlemessagesource, for example.
this implementation returns a simpletheme instance, holding a resourcebundle-based messagesource whose basename corresponds to the given theme name (prefixed by the configured "basenameprefix"). simpletheme instances are cached per theme name. use a reloadable messagesource if themes should reflect changes to the underlying files.
initialize the themesource for the given application context, autodetecting a bean with the name "themesource". if no such bean is found, a default (empty) themesource will be used.
return the detail message, including the message from the linked exception if there is one.

set the connectionfactory to use for the underlying jmstemplate.
actually execute the listener for a message received from the given consumer, fetching all requires resources and invoking the listener.
this implementation checks whether the session is externally synchronized. in this case, the session is not locally transacted, despite the listener container's "sessiontransacted" flag being set to "true".
perform a rollback, handling rollback exceptions properly.
process a message received from the provider. executes the listener, exposing the current jms session as thread-bound resource (if "exposelistenersession" is "true").
specify concurrency limits via a "lower-upper" string, e.g. "5-10", or a simple upper limit string, e.g. "10". this listener container will always hold on to the maximum number of consumers #setconcurrentconsumers since it is unable to scale. this property is primarily supported for configuration compatibility with generally use #setconcurrentconsumers instead.

apply the next back-off time using the specified backoffexecution. return true if the back-off period has been applied and a new attempt to recover should be made, false if no further attempt should be made.
specify the level of caching that this listener container is allowed to apply, in the form of the name of the corresponding constant: e.g. "cache_connection".
handle the given exception that arose during setup of a listener. called for every such exception in every concurrent listener. the default implementation logs the exception at warn level if not recovered yet, and at debug level if already recovered. can be overridden in subclasses. already recovered from the present listener setup failure (this usually indicates a follow-up failure than can be ignored other than for debug log purposes)
determine whether this listener container currently has more than one idle instance among its scheduled invokers.
refresh the underlying connection, not returning before an attempt has been successful. called in case of a shared connection as well as without shared connection, so either needs to operate on the shared connection or on a temporary connection that just gets established for validation purposes. the default implementation retries until it successfully established a connection, for as long as this message listener container is running. applies the specified recovery interval between retries.
specify concurrency limits via a "lower-upper" string, e.g. "5-10", or a simple upper limit string, e.g. "10" (the lower limit will be 1 in this case). this listener container will always hold on to the minimum number of consumers ( #setconcurrentconsumers) and will slowly scale up to the maximum number of consumers #setmaxconcurrentconsumers in case of increasing load.
stop this listener container, invoking the specific callback once all listener processing has actually stopped. note: further stop(runnable) calls (before processing has actually stopped) will override the specified callback. only the latest specified callback will be invoked. if a subsequent #start() call restarts the listener container before it has fully stopped, the callback will not get invoked at all. has fully stopped
schedule a new invoker, increasing the total number of scheduled invokers for this listener container.
resolve the destination to use for this instance. the destinationresolver and session can be used to resolve a destination at runtime.
extract the message body from the given jms message. as an argument

send the given response message to the given destination.
invoke the specified listener method.
invoke the handler, wrapping any exception to a listenerexecutionfailedexception with a dedicated error message.
set the destinationresolver to use for resolving destination names into the jca 1.5 activationspec "destination" property. if not specified, destination names will simply be passed in as strings. if specified, destination names will be resolved into destination objects first. note that a destinationresolver is usually specified on the jmsactivationspecfactory (see standardjmsactivationspecfactory#setdestinationresolver). this is simply a shortcut for parameterizing the default jmsactivationspecfactory; it will replace any custom jmsactivationspecfactory that might have been set before.
apply the specified acknowledge mode to the activationspec object. this implementation applies the standard jca 1.5 acknowledge modes "auto-acknowledge" and "dups-ok-acknowledge". it throws an exception in case of client_acknowledge or session_transacted having been requested. (according to the constants in javax.jms.session
populate the given applicationspec object with the settings defined in the given configuration object. this implementation applies all standard jms settings, but ignores "maxconcurrency" and "prefetchsize" - not supported in standard jca 1.5.
this implementation guesses the activationspec class name from the provider's class name: e.g. "activemqresourceadapter" -> "activemqactivationspec" in the same package, or a class named "activationspecimpl" in the same package as the resourceadapter class.
this implementation supports spring's extended "maxconcurrency" and "prefetchsize" settings through detecting corresponding activationspec properties: "maxsessions""maxnumberofworks" and "maxmessagespersessions""maxmessages", respectively (following activemq's and joram's naming conventions).
this implementation maps session_transacted onto an activationspec property named "useramanagedtransaction", if available (following activemq's naming conventions).
specify concurrency limits via a "lower-upper" string, e.g. "5-10", or a simple upper limit string, e.g. "10". jca listener containers will always scale from zero to the given upper limit. a specified lower limit will effectively be ignored. this property is primarily supported for configuration compatibility with for this activation config, generally use #setmaxconcurrency instead.

add the given, single header value under the given name.
set the heartbeat header. applies to the connect and connected frames.
clean up state associated with the connection and close it. any exception arising from closing the connection are propagated.
invoked after the stomp connected frame is received. at this point the connection is ready for sending stomp messages to the broker.
after a disconnect there should be no more client frames so we can close the connection pro-actively. however, if the disconnect has a receipt header we leave the connection open and expect the server will respond with a receipt and then close the connection. stomp specification 1.2 disconnect
forward the given message to the stomp broker. the method checks whether we have an active tcp connection and have received the stomp connected frame. for client messages this should be false only if we lose the tcp connection around the same time when a client message is being forwarded, so we simply log the ignored message at debug level. for messages from within the application being sent on the "system" connection an exception is raised so that components sending the message have a chance to handle it -- by default the broker message channel is synchronous. note that if messages arrive concurrently around the same time a tcp connection is lost, there is a brief period of time before the connection is reset when one or more messages may sneak through and an attempt made to forward them. rather than synchronizing to guard against that, this method simply lets them try and fail. for client sessions that may result in an additional stomp error frame(s) being sent downstream but code handling that downstream should be idempotent in such cases.
calculate the current buffer size.
decodes one or more stomp frames from the given bytebuffer into a list of message messages. if there was enough data to parse a "content-length" header, then the value is used to determine how much more data is needed before a new attempt to decode is made. if there was not enough data to parse the "content-length", or if there is "content-length" header, every subsequent call to decode attempts to parse again with all available data. therefore the presence of a "content-length" header helps to optimize the decoding of large messages.
an overloaded version of #connect(stompsessionhandler) that accepts headers to use for the stomp connect frame.
factory method for create and configure a new session.
configure the default value for the "heart-beat" header of the stomp connect frame. the first number represents how often the client will write or send a heart-beat. the second is how often the server should write. a value of 0 means no heart-beats. by default this is set to "10000,10000" but subclasses may override that default and for example set it to "0,0" if they require a taskscheduler to be configured first. http:stomp.github.iostomp-specification-1.2.html#heart-beating
further initialize the stompheaders, for example setting the heart-beat header if necessary.
decode a single stomp frame from the given buffer into a message.
see stomp spec 1.2:  href="http:stomp.github.iostomp-specification-1.2.html#value_encoding">"value encoding".
try to read an eol incrementing the buffer position if successful.
decodes one or more stomp frames from the given buffer and returns a list of message messages. if the given bytebuffer contains only partial stomp frame content and no complete stomp frames, an empty list is returned, and the buffer is reset to to where it was. if the buffer contains one ore more stomp frames, those are returned and the buffer reset to point to the beginning of the unused partial content. the output partialmessageheaders map is used to store successfully parsed headers in case of partial content. the caller can then check if a "content-length" header was read, which helps to determine how much more content is needed before the next attempt to decode. successfully parsed partialmessageheaders in case of partial message content in cases where the partial buffer ended with a partial stomp frame

create an instance from a bean instance, method name, and parameter types.
assert that the target bean class is an instance of the class where the given method is declared. in some cases the actual endpoint instance at request- processing time may be a jdk dynamic proxy (lazy initialization, prototype beans, and others). endpoint classes that require proxying should prefer class-based proxy mechanisms.
if the provided instance contains a bean name rather than an object instance, the bean name is resolved before a handlermethod is created and returned.
create an instance from a bean name, a method, and a beanfactory. the method #createwithresolvedbean() may be used later to re-create the handlermethod with an initialized bean.
returns a new instance with url patterns from the current instance ("this") and the "other" instance as follows:  if there are patterns in both instances, combine the patterns in "this" with the patterns in "other" using org.springframework.util.pathmatcher#combine(string, string). if only one instance has patterns, use them. if neither instance has patterns, use an empty string (i.e. ""). 
compare the two conditions based on the destination patterns they contain. patterns are compared one at a time, from top to bottom via if all compared patterns match equally, but one instance has more patterns, it is considered a closer match. it is assumed that both instances have been obtained via that match the request and are sorted with the best matches on top.
check if any of the patterns match the given message destination and return an instance that is guaranteed to contain matching patterns, sorted via or a new condition with sorted matching patterns; or null either if a destination can not be extracted or there is no match
when this property is configured only messages to destinations matching one of the configured prefixes are eligible for handling. when there is a match the prefix is removed and only the remaining part of the destination is used for method-mapping purposes. by default, no prefixes are configured in which case all messages are eligible for handling.
register a handler method and its unique mapping. under the same mapping
check whether the given destination (of an incoming message) matches to one of the configured destination prefixes and if so return the remaining portion of the destination after the matched prefix. if there are no matching prefixes, return null. if there are no destination prefixes, return the destination as is.
detect if the given handler has any methods that can handle messages and if so register it with the extracted mapping information.
create a handlermethod instance from an object handler that is either a handler instance or a string-based bean name.

set the spring jtatransactionmanager or the jta transactionmanager to be used with hibernate, if any. allows for using a spring-managed transaction manager for hibernate 5's session and cache synchronization, with the "hibernate.transaction.jta.platform" automatically set to it. a passed-in spring jtatransactionmanager needs to contain a jta case where we'll automatically set websphereextendedjtaplatform accordingly. note: if this is set, the hibernate settings should not contain a jta platform setting to avoid meaningless double configuration.
perform spring-based scanning for entity classes, registering them as annotated classes with this configuration.
check whether any of the configured entity type filters matches the current class descriptor contained in the metadata reader.
build the hibernate sessionfactory through background bootstrapping, using the given executor for a parallel initialization phase (e.g. a org.springframework.core.task.simpleasynctaskexecutor).  sessionfactory initialization will then switch into background bootstrap mode, with a sessionfactory proxy immediately returned for injection purposes instead of waiting for hibernate's bootstrapping to complete. however, note that the first actual call to a sessionfactory method will then block until hibernate's bootstrapping completed, if not ready by then. for maximum benefit, make sure to avoid early sessionfactory calls in init methods of related beans, even for metadata introspection purposes.
determine the spring resourceloader to use for hibernate metadata.
determine the hibernate metadatasources to use. can also be externally called to initialize and pre-populate a metadatasources instance which is then going to be used for sessionfactory building.

close the given jpa entitymanager, catching and logging any cleanup exceptions thrown.
apply the current transaction timeout, if any, to the given jpa query object. this method sets the jpa 2.0 query hint "javax.persistence.query.timeout" accordingly.
find an entitymanagerfactory with the given name in the given spring application context (represented as listablebeanfactory). the specified unit name will be matched against the configured persistence unit, provided that a discovered entitymanagerfactory implements the entitymanagerfactoryinfo interface. if not, the persistence unit name will be matched against the spring bean name, assuming that the entitymanagerfactory bean names follow that convention. if no unit name has been given, this method will search for a default entitymanagerfactory through listablebeanfactory#getbean(class). in which case a single bean of type entitymanagerfactory will be searched for)
convert the given runtime exception to an appropriate exception from the return null if no translation is appropriate: any other exception may have resulted from user code, and should not be translated. the most important cases like object not found or optimistic locking failure are covered here. for more fine-granular conversion, jpatransactionmanager etc support sophisticated translation of exceptions via a jpadialect. or null if the exception should not be translated

determine jpa's default "meta-inform.xml" resource for use with spring's default persistence unit, if any. checks whether a "meta-inform.xml" file exists in the classpath and uses it if it is not co-located with a "meta-infpersistence.xml" file.
perform spring-based scanning for entity classes.
try to determine the persistence unit root url based on the given "defaultpersistenceunitrootlocation".
hook method allowing subclasses to customize each persistenceunitinfo. the default implementation delegates to all registered persistenceunitpostprocessors. it is usually preferable to register further entity classes, jar files etc there rather than in a subclass of this manager, to be able to reuse the post-processors. passed in as mutablepersistenceunitinfo.

register a clinitadder which will add code to the static initializer in the generated class to support the code produced by an ast nodes primary generatecode() method.
return if the supplied array type has a core component reference type.
determine the jvm descriptor for a specified class. unlike the other descriptors used in the compilation process, this is the one the jvm wants, so this one includes any necessary trailing semicolon (e.g. ljavalangstring; rather than ljavalangstring)
produce the correct bytecode to build an array. the opcode to use and the signature to pass along with the opcode can vary depending on the signature of the array type.
create the jvm signature descriptor for a method. this consists of the descriptors for the method parameters surrounded with parentheses, followed by the descriptor for the return type. note the descriptors here are jvm descriptors, unlike the other descriptor forms the compiler is using which do not include the trailing semicolon.

execute a function represented as a java.lang.reflect.method.
determines the set of property resolvers that should be used to try and access a property on the specified target type. the resolvers are considered to be in an ordered list, however in the returned list any that are exact matches for the input target type (as opposed to 'general' resolvers that could work for any type) are placed at the start of the list. in addition, there are specific resolvers that exactly name the class in question and resolvers that name a specific class but it is a supertype of the class we have. these are put at the end of the specific resolvers set and will be tried after exactly matching accessors but before generic accessors.
attempt to read the named property from the current context object.
go through the list of registered constructor resolvers and see if any can find a constructor that takes the specified set of arguments.
create a new ordinary object and return it.

a method reference is compilable if it has been resolved to a reflectively accessible method and the child nodes (arguments to the method) are also compilable.
determines the set of property resolvers that should be used to try and access a property on the specified target type. the resolvers are considered to be in an ordered list, however in the returned list any that are exact matches for the input target type (as opposed to 'general' resolvers that could work for any type) are placed at the start of the list. in addition, there are specific resolvers that exactly name the class in question and resolvers that name a specific class but it is a supertype of the class we have. these are put at the end of the specific resolvers set and will be tried after exactly matching accessors but before generic accessors.
produce a readable representation for a given method name with specified arguments.
perform an equality check for the given operand values. this method is not just used for reflective comparisons in subclasses but also from compiled expression code, which is why it needs to be declared as public static here.
return an object that indicates whether the input descriptors are compatible. a declared descriptor is what could statically be determined (e.g. from looking at the return value of a property accessor method) whilst an actual descriptor is the type of an actual object that was returned, which may differ. for generic types with unbound type variables, the declared descriptor discovered may be 'object' but from the actual descriptor it is possible to observe that the objects are really numeric values (e.g. ints).
string format for all operators is the same
numeric comparison operators share very similar generated code, only differing in two comparison instructions.
process the string form of a number, using the specified base if supplied and return an appropriate literal to hold it. any suffix to indicate a long will be taken into account (either 'l' or 'l' is supported).
if all the components of the list are constants, or lists that themselves contain constants, then a constant list can be built to represent this node. this will speed up later getvalue calls and reduce the amount of garbage created.
ask an argument to generate its bytecode and then follow it up with any boxingunboxingcheckcasting to ensure it matches the expected parameter descriptor.
generate code that handles building the argument values for the specified method. this method will take account of whether the invoked method is a varargs method and if it is then the argument values will be appropriately packaged into an array.
check the first operand matches the regex specified as the second operand. second operand, otherwise false (e.g. the regex is invalid)
compare the left operand to see it is an instance of the type specified as the right operand. the right operand must be a class. otherwise false
if all the components of the map are constants, or listsmaps that themselves contain constants, then a constant list can be built to represent this node. this will speed up later getvalue calls and reduce the amount of garbage created.
evaluate the condition and if true evaluate the first alternative, otherwise evaluate the second alternative. a boolean or there is a problem executing the chosen alternative
implements the multiply operator directly here for certain types of supported operands and otherwise delegates to any registered overloader for types not supported here. supported operand types:  numbers string and int ('abc' 2 == 'abcabc') 
convert operand value to string using registered converter or using
walk through a possible tree of nodes that combine strings and append them all to the same (on stack) stringbuilder.
returns a boolean based on whether a value is in the range expressed. the first operand is any value whilst the second is a list of two values - those two values being the bounds allowed for the first operand (inclusive).
find a field of a certain name on a specified class.
attempt to create an optimized property accessor tailored for a property of a particular name on a particular class. the general reflectivepropertyaccessor will always work but is not optimal due to the need to lookup which reflective member (methodfield) to use each time read() is called. this method will just return the reflectivepropertyaccessor instance if it is unable to build a more optimal accessor. note: an optimal accessor is currently only usable for read attempts. do not call this method if you need a read-write accessor.
return the method suffixes for a given property name. the default implementation uses javabean conventions with additional support for properties of the form 'xy' where the method 'getxy()' is used in preference to the javabean convention of 'getxy()'.
return the method suffix for a given property name. the default implementation uses javabean conventions.
compare argument arrays and return information about whether they match. a supplied type converter and conversionallowed flag allow for matches to take into account that a type may be transformed into a different type by the converter. this variant of comparearguments also allows for a varargs match. or null if it was not a match
takes an input set of argument values and converts them to the types specified as the required parameter types. the arguments are converted 'in-place' in the input array. ( null if not varargs)
package up the arguments so that they correctly match what is expected in parametertypes. for example, if parametertypes is (int, string[]) because the second parameter was declared string..., then if arguments is [1,"a","b"] then it must be repackaged as [1,new string[]"a","b"] in order to match the expected types.
compare argument arrays and return information about whether they match. a supplied type converter and conversionallowed flag allow for matches to take into account that a type may be transformed into a different type by the converter. or null if it was not a match
convert a supplied set of arguments into the requested types. if the parametertypes are related to a varargs method then the final entry in the parametertypes array is going to be an array itself whose component type should be used as the conversion target for extraneous arguments. (for example, if the parametertypes are integer, string[] and the input arguments are integer, boolean, float then both the boolean and float must be converted to strings). this method does not repackage the arguments into a form suitable for the varargs invocation - a subsequent call to setupargumentsforvarargsinvocation handles that.
based on methodinvoker#gettypedifferenceweight(class[], object[]) but operates on typedescriptors.
check if the supplied value is the first entry in the array represented by the possiblearray value.
register a filter for methods on the given type. or null to clear any filter for the given type
locate a method on a type. there are three kinds of match that might occur:  an exact match where the types of the arguments match the types of the constructor an in-exact match where the types we are looking for are subtypes of those defined on the constructor a match where we are able to convert the arguments into those expected by the constructor, according to the registered type converter 
create a simpleevaluationcontext for the specified propertyaccessor delegates: typically a custom propertyaccessor specific to a use case (e.g. attribute resolution in a custom data structure), potentially combined with a databindingpropertyaccessor if property dereferences are needed as well.
register the specified methodresolver delegates for a combination of property access and method resolution.
register a methodfilter which will be called during method resolution for the specified type. the methodfilter may remove methods andor sort the methods which will then be used by spel as the candidates to look through for a match.
find a (possibly unqualified) type reference - first using the type name as-is, then trying any registered prefixes if the type name cannot be found.
locate a constructor on the type. there are three kinds of match that might occur:  an exact match where the types of the arguments match the types of the constructor an in-exact match where the types we are looking for are subtypes of those defined on the constructor a match where we are able to convert the arguments into those expected by the constructor, according to the registered type converter. 
create a new executor for the given method.
copes with nesting, for example '$...$...' where the correct end for the first $ is the final . matching end suffix is being sought
return true if the specified suffix can be found at the supplied position in the supplied expression string.
helper that parses given expression string using the configured parser. the expression string can contain any number of expressions all contained in "$..." markers. for instance: "foo$expr0bar$expr1". the static pieces of text will also be returned as expressions that just return that static piece of text. as a result, evaluating all returned expressions and concatenating the results produces the complete evaluated string. unwrapping is only done of the outermost delimiters found, so the string 'hello $foo$abc' would break into the pieces 'hello ' and 'foo$abc'. this means that expression languages that used $.. as part of their functionality are supported without any problem. the parsing is aware of the structure of an embedded expression. it assumes that parentheses '(', square brackets '[' and curly brackets '' must be in pairs within the expression unless they are within a string literal and a string literal starts and terminates with a single quote '.
determines if there is a type converter available in the specified context and attempts to use it to convert the supplied value to the specified type. throws an exception if conversion is not possible. of the value to the specified type is not supported

register all specified listeners with the scheduler.
register jobs and triggers (within a transaction, if possible).
register a list of jobdetail objects with the scheduler that this factorybean creates, to be referenced by triggers. this is not necessary when a trigger determines the jobdetail itself: in this case, the jobdetail will be implicitly registered in combination with the trigger.
this implementation applies the passed-in job data map as bean property values, and delegates to executeinternal afterwards.

determine the default java activation filetypemap for the given mimemessage. or a default configurablemimefiletypemap if none found for the message
determine the mimemultipart objects to use, which will be used to store attachments on the one hand and text(s) and inline elements on the other hand. texts and inline elements can either be stored in the root element itself (multipart_mode_mixed, multipart_mode_related) or in a nested element rather than the root element directly (multipart_mode_mixed_related). by default, the root mimemultipart element will be of type "mixed" (multipart_mode_mixed) or "related" (multipart_mode_related). the main multipart element will either be added as nested element of type "related" (multipart_mode_mixed_related) or be identical to the root element itself (multipart_mode_mixed, multipart_mode_related). object to (mixed, related, mixed_related, or no)

set the xa transaction manager to use for wrapping endpoint invocations, enlisting the endpoint resource in each such transaction. the passed-in object may be a transaction manager which implements spring's org.springframework.transaction.jta.transactionfactory interface, or a plain javax.transaction.transactionmanager. if no transaction manager is specified, the endpoint invocation will simply not be wrapped in an xa transaction. check out your resource provider's activationspec documentation for local transaction options of your particular provider.
the standard jca 1.5 version of createendpoint. this implementation delegates to #createendpointinternal(), initializing the endpoint's xaresource before the endpoint gets invoked.
this beforedelivery implementation starts a transaction, if necessary, and exposes the endpoint classloader as current thread context classloader. note that the jca 1.7 specification does not require a resourceadapter to call this method before invoking the concrete endpoint. if this method has not been called (check #hasbeforedeliverybeencalled()), the concrete endpoint method should call beforedelivery and its sibling #afterdelivery() explicitly, as part of its own processing.
this afterdelivery implementation resets the thread context classloader and completes the transaction, if any. note that the jca 1.7 specification does not require a resourceadapter to call this method after invoking the concrete endpoint. see the explanation in #beforedelivery's javadoc.

this implementation checks the usertransaction's rollback-only flag.
create a new springjtasynchronizationadapter for the given spring transactionsynchronization and jta transactionmanager. note that this adapter will never perform a rollback-only call on weblogic, since weblogic server is known to automatically mark the transaction as rollback-only in case of a beforecompletion exception. hence, on wls, this constructor is equivalent to the single-arg constructor. setting in case of an exception thrown in beforecompletion (can be omitted if the jta provider itself marks the transaction rollback-only in such a scenario, which is required by the jta specification as of jta 1.1)

return a timeout cleanup task to invoke if the sockjs sessions is not fully established within the retransmission timeout period calculated in request.
create a new sockjshttprequesthandler.
this method determines the sockjs path and handles sockjs static urls. session urls and raw websocket requests are delegated to abstract methods.
ensure the path does not contain a file extension, either in the filename (e.g. "jsonp.bat") or possibly after path parameters ("jsonp;setup.bat") which could be used for rfd exploits. since the last part of the path is expected to be a transport type, the presence of an extension would not work. all we need to do is check if there are any path parameters, which would have been removed from the sockjs path during request mapping, and if found reject the request.
create a transporthandlingsockjsservice with given transporthandler handler types. the provided taskscheduler should be declared as a spring bean to ensure it gets initialized at start-up and shuts down when the application stops

handle an inbound message from a websocket client.
register a sub-protocol handler.
find a subprotocolhandler for the given session.
handle an outbound spring message to a websocket client.
when a session is connected through a higher-level protocol it has a chance to use heartbeat management to shut down sessions that are too slow to send or receive messages. however, after a websocketsession is established and before the higher level protocol is fully connected there is a possibility for sessions to hang. this method checks and closes any sessions that have been connected for more than 60 seconds without having received a single message.

set whether to use statements that are capable of returning updatable resultsets.
add anonymous parameters, specifying only their sql types as defined in the java.sql.types class. parameter ordering is significant. this method is an alternative to the #declareparameter method, which should normally be preferred.
declare a parameter for this operation. the order in which this method is called is significant when using positional parameters. it is not significant when using named parameters with named sqlparameter objects here; it remains significant when using named parameters in combination with unnamed sqlparameter objects here. the parameter's name. note that you typically use the sqlparameter class itself here, not any of its subclasses. and hence cannot be configured further
compile this query. ignores subsequent attempts to compile. been correctly initialized, for example if no datasource has been provided
validate the named parameters passed to an execute method based on declared parameters. subclasses should invoke this method before every executequery() or
check whether this operation has been compiled already; lazily compile it if not already compiled. automatically called by validateparameters.
analogous to the sqlquery.execute([]) method. this is a generic method to execute a query, taken a number of arguments. object wrapper types for primitives.
execute the stored procedure with the provided parameter values. this is a convenience method where the order of the passed in parameter values must match the order that the parameters where declared in. not be included in this map. it is legal for values to be null, and this will produce the correct behavior using a null argument to the stored procedure. output parameters will appear here, with their values after the stored procedure has been called.
declare a parameter. overridden method. parameters declared as sqlparameter and sqlinoutparameter will always be used to provide input values. in addition to this any parameter declared as sqloutparameter where an non-null input value is provided will also be used as an input paraneter. note: calls to declareparameter must be made in the same order as they appear in the database's stored procedure parameter list. names are purely used to help mapping.
overridden method to configure the preparedstatementcreatorfactory based on our declared parameters.
central execution method. all named parameter execution goes through this method. the sqlparameters. primitive parameters must be represented by their object wrapper type. the ordering of parameters is not significant since they are supplied in a sqlparametermap which is an implementation of the map interface. callback method. the jdbc operation itself doesn't rely on this parameter, but it can be useful for creating the objects of the result list. will be of the same class, although it is possible to use different types.

return whether the given jdbc driver supports jdbc 2.0 batch updates. typically invoked right before execution of a given set of statements: to decide whether the set of sql statements should be executed through the jdbc 2.0 batch mechanism or simply in a traditional one-by-one fashion. logs a warning if the "supportsbatchupdates" methods throws an exception and simply returns false in that case.
retrieve a jdbc column value from a resultset, using the specified value type. uses the specifically typed resultset accessor methods, falling back to note that the returned value may not be assignable to the specified required type, in case of an unknown type. calling code needs to deal with this case appropriately, e.g. throwing a corresponding exception. with further conversion steps necessary)
convert a column name with underscores to the corresponding property name using "camel case". a name like "customer_number" would match a "customernumber" property name.
extract database meta-data via the given databasemetadatacallback. this method will open a connection to the database and retrieve the database meta-data. since this method is called before the exception translation feature is configured for a datasource, this method can not rely on the sqlexception translation functionality. any exceptions will be wrapped in a metadataaccessexception. this is a checked exception and any calling code should catch and handle this exception. you can just log the error and hope for the best, but there is probably a more serious error that will reappear when you try to access the database again. the databasemetadatacallback's processmetadata method
close the given jdbc statement and ignore any thrown exception. this is useful for typical finally blocks in manual jdbc code.
retrieve a jdbc column value from a resultset, using the most appropriate value type. the returned value should be a detached value object, not having any ties to the active resultset: in particular, it should not be a blob or clob object but rather a byte array or string representation, respectively. uses the getobject(index) method, but includes additional "hacks" to get around oracle 10g returning a non-standard object for its timestamp datatype and a java.sql.date for date columns leaving out the time portion: these columns will explicitly be extracted as standard
extract a common name for the target database in use even if various driversplatforms provide varying names at runtime.
call the specified method on databasemetadata for the given datasource, and extract the invocation result. or failed to invoke the specified method
close the given jdbc connection and ignore any thrown exception. this is useful for typical finally blocks in manual jdbc code.
determine the column name to use. the column name is determined based on a lookup using resultsetmetadata. this method implementation takes into account recent clarifications expressed in the jdbc 4.0 specification: columnlabel - the label for the column specified with the sql as clause. if the sql as clause was not specified, then the label is the name of the column.
close the given jdbc resultset and ignore any thrown exception. this is useful for typical finally blocks in manual jdbc code.

statement to use to clean up "sequence" values. the default implementation either deletes the entire range below the current maximum value, or the specifically generated values (starting with the lowest minus 1, just preserving the maximum value) - according to the #isdeletespecificvalues() setting. (the number of values corresponds to #getcachesize())
set the default isolation level by the name of the corresponding constant in org.springframework.transaction.transactiondefinition, e.g. "isolation_serializable". if not specified, the target datasource's default will be used. note that a transaction-specific isolation value will always override any isolation setting specified at the datasource level.
applies the current isolation level value and read-only flag to the returned connection.
specify the default isolation level to use for connection retrieval, according to the jdbc java.sql.connection constants (equivalent to the corresponding spring if not specified, the target datasource's default will be used. note that a transaction-specific isolation value will always override any isolation setting specified at the datasource level.
this implementation sets the isolation level but ignores the timeout.
prepare the transactional connection right after transaction begin. the default implementation executes a "set transaction read only" statement if the #setenforcereadonly "enforcereadonly" flag is set to true and the transaction definition indicates a read-only transaction. the "set transaction read only" is understood by oracle, mysql and postgres and may work with other databases as well. if you'd like to adapt this treatment, override this method accordingly.
wraps the given connection with a proxy that delegates every method call to it but delegates close() calls to datasourceutils.
prepare the given connection before it is exposed. the default implementation applies the auto-commit flag, if necessary. can be overridden in subclasses.
specifying a custom username and password doesn't make sense with a single connection. returns the single connection if given the same username and password; throws a sqlexception else.
wrap the given connection with a proxy that delegates every method call to it but suppresses close calls.
initialize the underlying connection via the drivermanager.
determine whether there are currently thread-bound credentials, using them if available, falling back to the statically specified username and password (i.e. values of the bean properties) otherwise. delegates to #dogetconnection(string, string) with the determined credentials as parameters.
override the existing connection handle with the given connection. reset the handle if given null. used for releasing the connection on suspend (with a null argument) and setting a fresh connection on resume.

obtain a connection from the given datasource. translates sqlexceptions into the spring hierarchy of unchecked generic data access exceptions, simplifying calling code and making any exception that is thrown more meaningful. is aware of a corresponding connection bound to the current thread, for example when using datasourcetransactionmanager. will bind a connection to the thread if transaction synchronization is active, e.g. when running within a if the attempt to get a connection failed
reset the given connection after a transaction, regarding read-only flag and isolation level.
actually obtain a jdbc connection from the given datasource. same as #getconnection, but throwing the original sqlexception. is aware of a corresponding connection bound to the current thread, for example when using datasourcetransactionmanager. will bind a connection to the thread if transaction synchronization is active (e.g. if in a jta transaction). directly accessed by transactionawaredatasourceproxy.
actually close the given connection, obtained from the given datasource. same as #releaseconnection, but throwing the original sqlexception. directly accessed by transactionawaredatasourceproxy. (if this is null, the call will be ignored) (may be null)
determine whether the given two connections are equal, asking the target connection in case of a proxy. used to detect equality even if the user passed in a raw target connection while the held one is a proxy. (potentially a target connection without proxy)
close the connection, unless a smartdatasource doesn't want us to.
apply the specified timeout - overridden by the current transaction timeout, if any - to the given jdbc statement object.
close the given connection, obtained from the given datasource, if it is not managed externally (that is, not bound to the thread). (if this is null, the call will be ignored) (may be null)

return the target connection, fetching it and initializing it if necessary.
check the default connection properties (auto-commit, transaction isolation), keeping them to be able to expose them correctly without fetching an actual jdbc connection from the target datasource. this will be invoked once on startup, but also for each retrieval of a target connection. if the check failed on startup (because the database was down), we'll lazily retrieve those settings.
return a connection handle that lazily fetches an actual jdbc connection when asked for a statement (or preparedstatement or callablestatement). the returned connection handle implements the connectionproxy interface, allowing to retrieve the underlying target connection.

build properties for the driver, including the given username and password (if any), and obtain a corresponding connection.
set the jdbc driver class name. this driver will get initialized on startup, registering itself with the jdk's drivermanager. note: drivermanagerdatasource is primarily intended for accessing pre-registered jdbc drivers. if you need to register a new driver, consider using simpledriverdatasource instead. alternatively, consider initializing the jdbc driver yourself before instantiating this datasource. the "driverclassname" property is mainly preserved for backwards compatibility, as well as for migrating between commons dbcp and this datasource.
builds a websphere jdbcconnectionspec object for the current settings and calls wsdatasource.getconnection(jdbcconnectionspec).
checks that the specified 'targetdatasource' actually is a websphere wsdatasource.
this constructor retrieves the websphere jdbc connection spec api, so we can get obtain specific websphere connections using reflection.

extract output parameters from the completed stored procedure.
throw an sqlwarningexception if encountering an actual warning. may be null, in which case this method does nothing.
query using a prepared statement, allowing for a preparedstatementcreator and a preparedstatementsetter. most other query methods use this method, but application code will always work with either a creator or a setter. connection if this is null, the sql will be assumed to contain no bind parameters.
create a map instance to be used as the results map. if #resultsmapcaseinsensitive has been set to true, a linkedcaseinsensitivemap will be created; otherwise, a
process the given resultset from a stored procedure.

same as #expectcontent(string, org.hamcrest.matcher) expect that you can pass arguments to the path. this is useful in situations where you have e.g. pre-defined variables that constitutes the path:  string somesubpath = "else"; int index = 1; expect().body("something.%s[%d]", withargs(somesubpath, index), equalto("some value")). ..   or if you have complex root paths and don't wish to duplicate the path for small variations:  expect(). root("filters.filterconfig[%d].filterconfiggroups.find it.name == 'gold' .includes"). body(withargs(0), hasitem("first")). body(withargs(1), hasitem("second")). ..   the path and arguments follows the standard  href="http:download.oracle.comjavase1,5.0docsapijavautilformatter.html#syntax">formatting syntax of java.  note that withargs can be statically imported from the io.restassured.restassured class. 
expect that the json or xml response content conforms to one or more hamcrest matchers. json example  assume that a get request to "lotto" returns a json response containing:  "lotto": "lottoid":5, "winning-numbers":[2,45,34,23,7,5,3], "winners":[ "winnerid":23, "numbers":[2,45,34,23,3,5] , "winnerid":54, "numbers":[52,3,12,11,18,22] ]   you can verify that the lottoid is equal to 5 like this:  responsespecbuilder builder = new responsespecbuilder(); builder.expectcontent("lotto.lottoid", equalto(5));

enables logging with the supplied log detail of the request made to authenticate using form authentication using the specified logconfig. both the request and the response is logged.
enable cross-site request forgery (csrf) support when using form authentication by automatically trying to find the name and value of the csrf input field. for example if the login page looks like this:  <html> <head> <title>login<title> <head> <body> <form action="j_spring_security_check_with_csrf" method="post"> <table> <tr> <td>user:&nbsp;<td> <td><input type="text" name="j_username"><td> <tr> <tr> <td>password:<td> <td><input type="password" name="j_password"><td> <tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><input name="submit" type="submit"><td> <tr> <table> <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="8adf2ea1-b246-40aa-8e13-a85fb7914341"> <form> <body> <html>  the csrf field name is called _csrf and rest assured will autodetect its name since the field name is the only hidden field on this page. if auto-detection fails you can consider using #withcsrffieldname(string).  important: when enabling csrf support then rest assured must always make an additional request to the server in order to be able to include in the csrf value which will slow down the tests.
include multiple additional fields when using form authentication by including input field values with the specified name. this is the same as #withadditionalfield(string) but for multiple fields.  important: when including an additional field without specifying a value then rest assured must always make an additional request to the server in order to be able to figure out the field value. this will slow down the tests.
include additional field when using form authentication by including input field value with the specified name. for example if the login page looks like this:  <html> <head> <title>login<title> <head> <body> <form action="j_spring_security_check_with_csrf" method="post"> <table> <tr> <td>user:&nbsp;<td> <td><input type="text" name="j_username"><td> <tr> <tr> <td>password:<td> <td><input type="password" name="j_password"><td> <tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><input name="submit" type="submit"><td> <tr> <table> <input type="hidden" name="something" value="8adf2ea1-b246-40aa-8e13-a85fb7914341"> <form> <body> <html>  and you'd like to include the field named something as an additional form parameter in the request you can do like this:  given().auth().form(..., new formauthconfig(..).withadditionalfield("something"). ..  and then rest assured will send the form parameter something=8adf2ea1-b246-40aa-8e13-a85fb7914341  important: when including an additional field without specifying a value then rest assured must always make an additional request to the server in order to be able to figure out the field value. this will slow down the tests.
enable cross-site request forgery (csrf) support when using form authentication by including the csrf value of the input field with the specified name. for example if the login page looks like this:  <html> <head> <title>login<title> <head> <body> <form action="j_spring_security_check_with_csrf" method="post"> <table> <tr> <td>user:&nbsp;<td> <td><input type="text" name="j_username"><td> <tr> <tr> <td>password:<td> <td><input type="password" name="j_password"><td> <tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><input name="submit" type="submit"><td> <tr> <table> <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="8adf2ea1-b246-40aa-8e13-a85fb7914341"> <form> <body> <html>  the csrf field name is called _csrf.  important: when enabling csrf support then rest assured must always make an additional request to the server in order to be able to include in the csrf value which will slow down the tests.
use preemptive http basic authentication. this means that the authentication details are sent in the request header regardless if the server has challenged for authentication or not.
use relaxed http validation. this means that you'll trust all hosts regardless if the ssl certificate is invalid. by using this method you don't need to specify a keystore (see #keystore(string, string) or trust store (see #truststore(java.security.keystore).

set a value of a feature flag.
declares a namespace and also sets #namespaceaware(boolean) to true.  note that you cannot use this to add namespaces for the org.hamcrest.xml.hasxpath matcher. this has to be done by providing a javax.xml.namespace.namespacecontext to the matcher instance.
set a value of a property.
disables external dtd loading.  this is a shortcut for doing:  setfeature("http:apache.orgxmlfeaturesnonvalidatingload-external-dtd", false);  
define headers that should be overwritten instead of merged adding headers or using request specifications. note that by default all headers are merged except the @value #accept_header_name and @value #content_type_header_name headers. for example, if the header with name header1 is not marked as overwritable (default) and you do the following:  given().header("header1", "value1").header("header1, "value2"). ..   then header1 will be sent twice in the request:  header1: value1 header1: value2   if you configure header1 to be overwritable by doing:  given(). config(restassured.config().headerconfig(headerconfig().overwriteheaderswithname("header1")). header("header1", "value1"). header("header1", "value2"). ...  then header1 will only be sent once:  header1: value2 
define headers that should be be merged instead of overwritten when adding headers or using request specifications. note that by default all headers are merged except the @value #accept_header_name and @value #content_type_header_name headers. this method is thus mainly used to change to merge behavior for headers that by default are overwritten or the revert changes of a request specification merge.

default request encoder for a binary stream. acceptable argument types are:  inputstream byte[] bytearrayoutputstream closure  if a closure is given, it is executed with an outputstream passed as the single closure argument. any data sent to the stream from the body of the closure is used as the request content body.
helper method used by encoder methods to create an httpentity instance that encapsulates the request data. this may be used by any non-streaming encoder that needs to send textual data.
set the request body as a url-encoded list of parameters. this is typically used to simulate a http form post. for multi-valued parameters, enclose the values in a list, e.g. [ key1 : ['val1', 'val2'], key2 : 'etc.' ]
retrieve a encoder for the given content-type. this is called by httpbuilder to retrieve the correct encoder for a given content-type. the encoder is then used to serialize the request data in the request body. or null.
returns a map of default encoders. override this method to change what encoders are registered by default. you can of course call super.builddefaultencodermap() and then add or remove from that result as well.
accepts a collection or a javabean object which is converted to json. a map or collection will be converted to a jsonbuilder.. a string or gstring will be interpreted as valid json and passed directly as the request body (with charset conversion if necessary.)  if a closure is passed as the model, it will be executed as if it were a json object definition passed to a jsonbuilder. in order for the closure to be interpreted correctly, there must be a 'root' element immediately inside the closure. for example:  builder.post( json ) body = root first one = 1 two = '2' second = 'some string'   will return the following json string: "root":"first":"one":1,"two":"2","second":"some string"
encode the content as xml. the argument may be either an object whose tostring produces valid markup, or a closure which will be interpreted as a builder definition.
default handler used for a plain text content-type. acceptable argument types are:  closure writable reader  for closure argument, a printwriter is passed as the single argument to the closure. any data sent to the writer from the closure will be sent to the request content body.

default constructor taking a name and a value. the value may be null.
utility method to convert a number of type to a uri instance. valid uri string from its tostring() result.
implementation of groovy's as operator, to allow type conversion. uribuilder instance does not represent a valid url.
the document fragment, without a preceeding '#'
adds all parameters within the scanner to the list of parameters, as encoded by encoding. for example, a scanner containing the string a=1&b=2&c=3 would add the namevaluepair namevaluepairs a=1, b=2, and c=3 to the list of parameters.  note that this method has been copied from urlencodedutils#parse(java.util.list, java.util.scanner, string) but it doesn't do url decoding. 
set the path component of this uri. the value may be absolute or relative to the current path. e.g.  def uri = new uribuilder( 'http:localhostp1p2?a=1' )  uri.path = 'p3p2' assert uri.tostring() == 'http:localhostp3p2?a=1'  uri.path = 'p2a' assert uri.tostring() == 'http:localhostp3p2a?a=1'  uri.path = '..p4' assert uri.tostring() ==   cannot be converted to a valid uri
set the query portion of the uri. for query parameters with multiple values, put the values in a list like so: uri.query = [ p1:'val1', p2:['val2', 'val3'] ] will produce a query string of ?p1=val1&p2=val2&p2=val3
remove the given query parameter from this uri's query string.
returns a string that is suitable for use as an applicationx-www-form-urlencoded list of parameters in an http put or http post.  this is a copy of urlencodedutils#format(java.util.list, string) that also handles basicnamevaluepairwithnovaluesupport. 
set the uri scheme, aka the 'protocol.' e.g. setscheme('https')
get the query string as a map for convenience. if any parameter contains multiple values (e.g. p1=one&p1=two) both values will be inserted into a list for that paramter key ([p1 : ['one','two']] ). note that this is not a "live" map. therefore, you cannot call  uri.query.a = 'bcd' you will not modify the query string but instead the generated map of parameters. instead, you need to use #removequeryparam(string) first, then call #setquery(map) which will set the entire query string. string.
add these parameters to the uribuilder's existing query string. parameters may be passed either as a single map argument, or as a list of named arguments. e.g.  uribuilder.addqueryparams( [one:1,two:2] ) uribuilder.addqueryparams( three : 3 )   if any of the parameters already exist in the uri query, these values will not replace them. multiple values for the same query parameter may be added by putting them in a list. see
returns a gzipinputstream which wraps the original entity's content stream
this implementation adds a gzipencoding and deflateencoding handler to the registry. override this method to provide a different set of defaults.
add the request and response interceptors to the httpclient, which will provide transparent decoding of the given content-encoding types. this method is called by httpbuilder and probably should not need be modified by sub-classes. a content-encoding string.
 convenience method to perform an http form patch. the response closure will be called only on a successful response.  a 'failed' response (i.e. any http status code > 399) will be handled by the registered 'failure' handler. the #defaultfailurehandler(httpresponsedecorator) default failure handler throws an httpresponseexception.  the request body (specified by a body named parameter) will be converted to a url-encoded form string unless a different requestcontenttype named parameter is passed to this method. (see encoderregistry#encodeform(map).)  represent a valid uri
set the default http proxy to be used for all requests.
parse the response data based on the given content-type. if the given content-type is contenttype#any, the content-type header from the response will be used to determine how to parse the response. content-type, or null if no parser could be found for this content-type. the parser will also return null if the response does not contain any content (e.g. in response to a head request).
valid arguments:  urieither a uri, url, or object whose tostring() method produces a valid uri string. if this parameter is not supplied, the httpbuilder's default uri is used. pathrequest path that is merged with the uri querymap of url query parameters headersmap of http headers contenttyperequest content type and accept header. if not supplied, the httpbuilder's default content-type is used. requestcontenttypecontent type for the request, if it is different from the expected response content-type bodyrequest body that will be encoded based on the given contenttype 
this is the default response.success handler. it will be executed if the response is not handled by a status-code-specific handler (i.e. response.'200'= ..) and no generic 'success' handler is given (i.e. response.success = ...) this handler simply returns the parsed data from the response body. in most cases you will probably want to define a response.success = ... handler from the request closure, which will replace the response handler defined by this method.   in practice, a user-supplied response handler closure is designed to handle streaming content so it can be read directly from the response stream without buffering, which will be much more efficient. therefore, it is recommended that request method variants be used which explicitly accept a response handler closure in these cases. response.
give a default uri to be used for all request methods that don't explicitly take a uri parameter. tostring() produces a valid uri string. see
create a requestconfigdelegate from the given arguments, execute the config closure, then pass the delegate to #dorequest(requestconfigdelegate), which actually executes the request.
set the request body. this value may be of any type supported by the associated encoderregistry request encoder. that is, the value of body will be interpreted by the encoder associated with the current #getrequestcontenttype() request content-type.
give a default uri to be used for all request methods that don't explicitly take a uri parameter, and a default content-type to be used for request encoding and response parsing. tostring() produces a valid uri string. see for common types.
creates default response handlers for status#success success and the handler map when a new httpbuilder instance is created.
set the default headers to add to all requests made by this builder instance. these values will replace any previously set default headers.
 convenience method to perform an http form post. the response closure will be called only on a successful response.  a 'failed' response (i.e. any http status code > 399) will be handled by the registered 'failure' handler. the #defaultfailurehandler(httpresponsedecorator) default failure handler throws an httpresponseexception.  the request body (specified by a body named parameter) will be converted to a url-encoded form string unless a different requestcontenttype named parameter is passed to this method.

prints the response to the print stream
returns true if the body in question probably contains human readable text. uses a small sample of code points to detect unicode control characters commonly used in binary file signatures.
change the level at which this interceptor logs.
returns an input stream containing one or more certificate pem files. this implementation just embeds the pem files in java strings; most applications will instead read this from a resource file that gets bundled with the application.
returns a trust manager that trusts certificates and none other. https services whose certificates have not been signed by these certificates will fail with a sslhandshakeexception. this can be used to replace the host platform's built-in trusted certificates with a custom set. this is useful in development where certificate authority-trusted certificates aren't available. or in production, to avoid reliance on third-party certificate authorities. see also certificatepinner, which can limit trusted certificates while still using the host platform's built-in trust store. warning: customizing trusted certificates is dangerous! relying on your own trusted certificates limits your server team's ability to update their tls certificates. by installing a specific set of trusted certificates, you take on additional operational complexity and limit your ability to migrate between certificate authorities. do not use custom trusted certificates in production without the blessing of your server's tls administrator.
returns a trust manager that trusts the vm's default certificate authorities.
returns the vm's default ssl socket factory, using trustmanager for trusted root certificates.

allocates and returns count fake addresses like [255.0.0.100, 255.0.0.101].
returns an okhttpclient for all tests to use as a starting point. the shared instance allows all tests to share a single connection pool, which prevents idle connections from consuming unnecessary resources while connections wait to be evicted. this client is also configured to be slightly more deterministic, returning a single ip address for all hosts, regardless of the actual number of ip addresses reported by dns.
sets the response cache to be used to read and write cached responses.
creates a java.net.cacheresponse of the correct (sub)type using information gathered from the supplied response.

extracts okhttp headers from the supplied java.net.httpurlconnection. only real headers are extracted. see #extractstatusline(java.net.httpurlconnection).
creates an okhttp response using the supplied request and cacheresponse to supply the data.
creates an okhttp request from the supplied information. this method allows a null value for requestheaders for situations where a connection is already connected and access to the headers has been lost. see java.net.httpurlconnection#getrequestproperties() for details.
creates an java.net.httpurlconnection of the correct subclass from the supplied okhttp
convert a request header to okhttp's cookies via httpcookie. that extra step handles multiple cookies in a single request header, which cookie#parse doesn't support.
creates a urlstreamhandler as a java.net.url#seturlstreamhandlerfactory. this code configures okhttp to handle all http and https connections created with java.net.url#openconnection():  okhttpclient okhttpclient = new okhttpclient(); url.seturlstreamhandlerfactory(new okurlfactory(okhttpclient)); 
returns an immutable map containing each field to its list of values. non-null, this value is mapped to the null key.
now that we've buffered the entire request body, update the request headers and the body itself. this happens late to enable httpurlconnection users to complete the socket connection before sending request body bytes.
returns the value of the field at position. returns null if there are fewer than position headers.
returns s with control characters and non-ascii characters replaced with '?'.
throws throwable as either an ioexception, runtimeexception, or error.
returns true if either:  a specific proxy was explicitly configured for this connection. the response has already been retrieved, and a proxy was java.net.proxyselector selected in order to get it.  warning: this method may return false before attempting to connect and true afterwards.
aggressively tries to get the final http response, potentially making many http requests in the process in order to cope with redirects and authentication.
returns an input stream from the server in the case of error such as the requested file (txt, htm, html) is not found on the remote server.
consumes the field name of the specified length and the optional colon and its optional trailing space. returns the number of bytes skipped.
consumes \r, \r\n, or \n from #source.
process the next event. this will result in a single call to callback#onevent unless the data section was empty. any number of calls to
returns true if the first bytes of #source are key followed by a colon or a newline.
either writes this request to sink or measures its content length. we have one method do double-duty to make sure the counting and content are consistent, particularly when it comes to awkward operations like measuring the encoded length of header strings, or the length-in-digits of an encoded integer.
configure a factory to provide per-call scoped listeners that will receive analytic events for this client.
configure a single client scoped listener that will receive all analytic events for this client.
sets the dispatcher used to set policy and execute asynchronous requests. must not be null.
sets the proxy selection policy to be used if no #proxy proxy is specified explicitly. the proxy selector may return multiple proxies; in that case they will be tried in sequence until a successful connection is established. if unset, the proxyselector#getdefault() system-wide default proxy selector will be used.
sets the certificate pinner that constrains which certificates are trusted. by default https connections rely on only the #sslsocketfactory ssl socket factory to establish trust. pinning certificates avoids the need to trust certificate authorities.
sets the connection pool used to recycle http and https connections. if unset, a new connection pool will be used.
sets the socket factory used to secure https connections. if unset, the system default will be used. a field that okhttp needs to build a clean certificate chain. this method instead must use reflection to extract the trust manager. applications should prefer to call #sslsocketfactory(sslsocketfactory, x509trustmanager), which avoids such reflection.
sets the socket factory used to create connections. okhttp only uses the parameterless socketfactory#createsocket() createsocket() method to create unconnected sockets. overriding this method, e. g., allows the socket to be bound to a specific local address. if unset, the socketfactory#getdefault() system-wide default socket factory will be used.
sets the socket factory and trust manager used to secure https connections. if unset, the system defaults will be used. most applications should not call this method, and instead use the system defaults. those classes include special optimizations that can be lost if the implementations are decorated. if necessary, you can create and configure the defaults yourself with the following code:  trustmanagerfactory trustmanagerfactory = trustmanagerfactory.getinstance( trustmanagerfactory.getdefaultalgorithm()); trustmanagerfactory.init((keystore) null); trustmanager[] trustmanagers = trustmanagerfactory.gettrustmanagers(); if (trustmanagers.length != 1 || !(trustmanagers[0] instanceof x509trustmanager)) throw new illegalstateexception("unexpected default trust managers:" + arrays.tostring(trustmanagers)); x509trustmanager trustmanager = (x509trustmanager) trustmanagers[0]; sslcontext sslcontext = sslcontext.getinstance("tls"); sslcontext.init(null, new trustmanager[] trustmanager , null); sslsocketfactory sslsocketfactory = sslcontext.getsocketfactory(); okhttpclient client = new okhttpclient.builder() .sslsocketfactory(sslsocketfactory, trustmanager) .build(); 
sets the handler that can accept cookies from incoming http responses and provides cookies to outgoing http requests. if unset, cookiejar#no_cookies no cookies will be accepted nor provided.
uses request to connect a new web socket.
sets the verifier used to confirm that response certificates apply to requested hostnames for https connections. if unset, a default hostname verifier will be used.
sets the dns service used to lookup ip addresses for hostnames. if unset, the dns#system system-wide default dns will be used.
sets the authenticator used to respond to challenges from proxy servers. use #authenticator to set the authenticator for origin servers. if unset, the authenticator#none no authentication will be attempted.
configure the protocols used by this client to communicate with remote servers. by default this client will prefer the most efficient transport available, falling back to more ubiquitous protocols. applications should only call this method to avoid specific compatibility problems, such as web servers that behave incorrectly when http2 is enabled. the following protocols are currently supported:   href="http:www.w3.orgprotocolsrfc2616rfc2616.html">http1.1  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc7540">h2  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc7540#section-3.4">h2 with prior knowledge (cleartext only)  this is an evolving set. future releases include support for transitional protocols. the http1.1 transport will never be dropped. if multiple protocols are specified,  href="http:tools.ietf.orghtmldraft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg">alpn will be used to negotiate a transport. protocol negotiation is only attempted for https urls.  protocol#http_1_0 is not supported in this set. requests are initiated with http1.1. if the server responds with http1.0, that will be exposed by response#protocol(). protocol#h2_prior_knowledge then that must be the only protocol and https urls will not be supported. otherwise the list must contain protocol#http_1_1. the list must not contain null or protocol#http_1_0.
sets the authenticator used to respond to challenges from origin servers. use #proxyauthenticator to set the authenticator for proxy servers. if unset, the authenticator#none no authentication will be attempted.
in a future release setting this to true will be unnecessary and setting it to false will have no effect.
applies this spec to sslsocket.
returns a copy of this that omits cipher suites and tls versions not enabled by sslsocket.
returns the response as a byte array. this method loads entire response body into memory. if the response body is very large this may trigger an outofmemoryerror. prefer to stream the response body if this is a possibility for your response.
returns a new response body that transmits content. if contenttype is non-null and lacks a charset, this will use utf-8.
returns a new response body that transmits content.
attempt to enqueue this async call on executorservice. this will attempt to clean up if the executor has been shut down by reporting the call as failed.
returns the charset that should be used to encode the credentials.
returns a copy of this charset that expects a credential encoded with charset.
sets this request's cache-control header, replacing any cache control headers already present. if cachecontrol doesn't define any directives, this clears this request's cache-control headers.
sets the url target of this request. exception by calling httpurl#parse; it returns null for invalid urls.
attaches tag to the request using type as a key. tags can be read from a request using request#tag. use null to remove any existing tag assigned for type. use this api to attach timing, debugging, or other application data to a request so that you may read it in interceptors, event listeners, or callbacks.
confirms that at least one of the certificates pinned for hostname is in peercertificates. does nothing if there are no certificates pinned for hostname. okhttp calls this after a successful tls handshake, but before the connection is used. pinned for hostname.
pins certificates for pattern. info, base64-encoded and prefixed with either sha256 or sha1.
returns a certificate pinner that uses certificatechaincleaner.
returns the sha-256 of certificate's public key. in okhttp 3.1.2 and earlier, this returned a sha-1 hash of the public key. both types are supported, but sha-256 is preferred.
returns list of matching certificates' pins for the hostname. returns an empty list if the hostname does not have pinned certificates.
promotes eligible calls from #readyasynccalls to #runningasynccalls and runs them on the executor service. must not be called with synchronization because executing calls can call into user code.
set the maximum number of requests for each host to execute concurrently. this limits requests by the url's host name. note that concurrent requests to a single ip address may still exceed this limit: multiple hostnames may share an ip address or be routed through the same http proxy. if more than maxrequestsperhost requests are in flight when this is invoked, those requests will remain in flight. websocket connections to hosts do not count against this limit.
set the maximum number of requests to execute concurrently. above this requests queue in memory, waiting for the running calls to complete. if more than maxrequests requests are in flight when this is invoked, those requests will remain in flight.
returns a snapshot of the calls currently awaiting execution.
cancel all calls currently enqueued or executing. includes calls executed both call#execute() synchronously and call#enqueue asynchronously.
returns a snapshot of the calls currently being executed.
returns headers for the alternating header names and values. there must be an even number of arguments, and they must alternate between header names and values.
add a header line without any validation. only appropriate for headers from the remote peer or cache.
adds all headers from an existing collection.
add a field with the specified value without any validation. only appropriate for headers from the remote peer or cache.
set a field with the specified date. if the field is not found, it is added. if the field is found, the existing values are replaced.
set a field with the specified instant. if the field is not found, it is added. if the field is found, the existing values are replaced.
returns headers for the header names and values in the map.
add a header with the specified name and formatted date. does validation of header names and value.
add a header with the specified name and formatted instant. does validation of header names and value.
returns an immutable case-insensitive set of header names.
equivalent to build().get(name), but potentially faster.
returns the last value corresponding to the specified field parsed as an http date, or null if either the field is absent or cannot be parsed as a date.
add an header line containing a field name, a literal colon, and a value.
returns an immutable list of the header values for name.
returns an iterator over the urls in this cache. this iterator doesn't throw concurrentmodificationexception, but if new responses are added while iterating, their urls will not be returned. if existing responses are evicted during iteration, they will be absent (unless they were already returned). the iterator supports iterator#remove. removing a url from the iterator evicts the corresponding response from the cache. use this to evict selected responses.
reads an entry from an input stream. a typical entry looks like this:  http:google.comfoo get 2 accept-language: fr-ca accept-charset: utf-8 http1.1 200 ok 3 content-type: imagepng content-length: 100 cache-control: max-age=600  a typical https file looks like this:  https:google.comfoo get 2 accept-language: fr-ca accept-charset: utf-8 http1.1 200 ok 3 content-type: imagepng content-length: 100 cache-control: max-age=600 aes_256_with_md5 2 base64-encoded peercertificate[0] base64-encoded peercertificate[1] -1 tlsv1.2  the file is newline separated. the first two lines are the url and the request method. next is the number of http vary request header lines, followed by those lines. next is the response status line, followed by the number of http response header lines, followed by those lines. https responses also contain ssl session information. this begins with a blank line, and then a line containing the cipher suite. next is the length of the peer certificate chain. these certificates are base64-encoded and appear each on their own line. the next line contains the length of the local certificate chain. these certificates are also base64-encoded and appear each on their own line. a length of -1 is used to encode a null array. the last line is optional. if present, it contains the tls version.
peeks up to bytecount bytes from the response body and returns them as a new response body. if fewer than bytecount bytes are in the response body, the full response body is returned. if more than bytecount bytes are in the response body, the returned value will be truncated to bytecount bytes. it is an error to call this method after the body has been consumed. warning: this method loads the requested bytes into memory. most applications should set a modest limit on bytecount, such as 1 mib.
closes the response body. equivalent to body().close(). it is an error to close a response that is not eligible for a body. this includes the responses returned from #cacheresponse, #networkresponse, and #priorresponse().
add a part to the body.
either writes this request to sink or measures its content length. we have one method do double-duty to make sure the counting and content are consistent, particularly when it comes to awkward operations like measuring the encoded length of header strings, or the length-in-digits of an encoded integer.
appends a quoted-string to a stringbuilder. rfc 2388 is rather vague about how one should escape special characters in form-data parameters, and as it turns out firefox and chrome actually do rather different things, and both say in their comments that they're not really sure what the right approach is. we go with chrome's behavior (which also experimentally seems to match what ie does), but if you actually want to have a good chance of things working, please avoid double-quotes, newlines, percent signs, and the like in your field names.
assemble the specified parts into a request body.
set the mime type. expected values for type are #mixed (the default), #alternative, #digest, #parallel and #form.
returns a list of encoded path segments like ["a", "b", "c"] for the url http:hostabc. this list is never empty though it may contain a single empty string.  summary=""> url encodedpathsegments()  http:host [""]  http:hostabc ["a", "b", "c"]  http:hostab%20cd ["a", "b%20c", "d"] 
returns this url as a uri java.net.uri. because uri is more strict than this class, the returned uri may be semantically different from this url:  characters forbidden by uri like [ and | will be escaped. invalid percent-encoded sequences like %xx will be encoded like %25xx. whitespace and control characters in the fragment will be stripped.  these differences may have a significant consequence when the uri is interpreted by a webserver. for this reason the uri uri class and this method should be avoided.
returns this url's encoded fragment, like "abc" for http:host#abc. this returns null if the url has no fragment.  summary=""> url encodedfragment()  http:hostnull  http:host# ""  http:host#abc "abc"  http:host#abc|def "abc|def" 
returns the first query parameter named name decoded using utf-8, or null if there is no such query parameter.  summary=""> url queryparameter("a")  http:hostnull  http:host?null  http:host?a=apple&k=key+lime "apple"  http:host?a=apple&a=apricot "apple"  http:host?a=apple&b "apple" 
returns the number of '' and '\' slashes in input, starting at pos.
returns the query of this url, encoded for use in http resource resolution. the returned string may be null (for urls with no query), empty (for urls with an empty query) or non-empty (all other urls).  summary=""> url encodedquery()  http:hostnull  http:host? ""  http:host?a=apple&k=key+lime "a=apple&k=key+lime"  http:host?a=apple&a=apricot "a=apple&a=apricot"  http:host?a=apple&b "a=apple&b" 
returns the index of the ':' in input that is after scheme characters. returns -1 if
adds a set of encoded path segments separated by a slash (either \ or ). if segment.
returns this url's query, like "abc" for http:host?abc. most callers should prefer #queryparametername and #queryparametervalue because these methods offer direct access to individual query parameters.  summary=""> url query()  http:hostnull  http:host? ""  http:host?a=apple&k=key+lime  lime"  http:host?a=apple&a=apricot "a=apple&a=apricot"  http:host?a=apple&b "a=apple&b" 
returns 80 if scheme.equals("http"), 443 if scheme.equals("https") and -1 otherwise.
removes a path segment. when this method returns the last segment is always "", which means the encoded path will have a trailing ''. popping "abc" yields "ab". in this case the list of path segments goes from ["a", "b", "c", ""] to ["a", "b", ""]. popping "abc" also yields "ab". the list of path segments goes from ["a", "b", "c"] to ["a", "b", ""].
returns a builder for the url that would be retrieved by following link from this url, or null if the resulting url is not well-formed.
returns the password, or an empty string if none is set.  summary=""> url encodedpassword()  http:host ""  http:username@host ""  http:username:password@host "password"  http:a%20b:c%20d@host "c%20d" 
returns all values for the query parameter name ordered by their appearance in this url. for example this returns ["banana"] for queryparametervalue("b") on   summary=""> url queryparametervalues("a") queryparametervalues("b")  http:host [] []  http:host? [] []  http:host?a=apple&k=key+lime ["apple"] []  http:host?a=apple&a=apricot ["apple", "apricot"] []  http:host?a=apple&b ["apple"] [null] 
adds a path segment. if the input is ".." or equivalent, this pops a path segment.
returns this url as a url java.net.url.
adds the pre-encoded query parameter to this url's query string.
finds the first ':' in input, skipping characters between square braces "[...]".
returns the distinct query parameter names in this url, like ["a", "b"] for  if this url has no query this returns the empty set.  summary=""> url queryparameternames()  http:host []  http:host? [""]  http:host?a=apple&k=key+lime ["a", "k"]  http:host?a=apple&a=apricot ["a"]  http:host?a=apple&b ["a", "b"] 
re-encodes the components of this url so that it satisfies (obsolete) rfc 2396, which is particularly strict for certain components.
cuts encodedquery up into alternating parameter names and values. this divides a query string like  into the list ["subject", "math", "easy", null, "problem", "5-2=3"]. note that values may be null and may contain '=' characters.
returns the entire path of this url encoded for use in http resource resolution. the returned path will start with "".  summary=""> url encodedpath()  http:host ""  http:hostabc "abc"  http:hostab%20cd "ab%20cd" 
encodes the query parameter using utf-8 and adds it to this url's query string.
returns a substring of input on the range [pos..limit) with the following transformations:  tabs, newlines, form feeds and carriage returns are skipped. in queries, ' ' is encoded to '+' and '+' is encoded to "%2b". characters in encodeset are percent-encoded. control characters and non-ascii characters are percent-encoded. all other characters are copied without transformation. 
returns the username, or an empty string if none is set.  summary=""> url encodedusername()  http:host ""  http:username@host "username"  http:username:password@host "username"  http:a%20b:c%20d@host "a%20b" 
address.
returns the protocol identified by protocol.
returns a media type for string.
returns a new request body that transmits content. if contenttype is non-null and lacks a charset, this will use utf-8.
returns a new request body that transmits the content of file.
returns a new request body that transmits content.
returns a new request body that transmits content.
for older cipher suites because the prefix is ssl_ instead of tls_.
for older cipher suites because the prefix is ssl_ instead of tls_.
returns the remote peer's principle, or null if that peer is anonymous.
returns the local principle, or null if this peer is anonymous.
necessary for example.com to match www.example.com under rfc 2965. this extra dot is ignored by more recent specifications.
returns the index of the next date character in input, or if invert the index of the next non-date character in input.
returns the positive value if attributevalue is positive, or long#min_value if it is either 0 or negative. if the value is positive but out of range, this returns long#max_value.
returns a domain string like example.com for an input domain like example.com or .example.com.
parse a date as specified in rfc 6265, section 5.1.1.
returns true if this cookie should be included on a request to url. in addition to this check callers should also confirm that this cookie has not expired.
returns all of the cookies from a set of http response headers.
sets the minimum number of seconds that a response will continue to be fresh for. if the response will be stale when minfresh have elapsed, the cached response will not be used and a network request will be made. timeunit#seconds precision; finer precision will be lost.
accept cached responses that have exceeded their freshness lifetime by up to maxstale. if unspecified, stale cache responses will not be used. timeunit#seconds precision; finer precision will be lost.
sets the maximum age of a cached response. if the cache response's age exceeds maxage, it will not be used and a network request will be made. timeunit#seconds precision; finer precision will be lost.
returns the cache directives of headers. this honors both cache-control and pragma headers if they are present.
decodes an ipv6 address like 1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888 or ::1.
closes socket, ignoring any checked exceptions. does nothing if socket is null.
closes closeable, ignoring any checked exceptions. does nothing if closeable is null.
returns an immutable copy of map.
equivalent to string.substring(pos, limit).trim().
returns the index of the first character in input that contains a character in delimiters. returns limit if there is no such character.
reads until in is exhausted or the deadline has been reached. this is careful to not extend the deadline if one exists already.
if host is an ip address, this returns the ip address in canonical form. otherwise this performs idn toascii encoding and canonicalize the result to lowercase. for example this converts ☃.net to xn--n3h.net, and www.google.com to if the result contains unsupported ascii characters.
returns the index of the first character in input that is delimiter. returns limit if there is no such character.
returns true if an http request for a and b can reuse a connection.
decodes an ipv4 address suffix of an ipv6 address, like 1111::5555:6666:192.168.0.1.
returns the index of the first character in input that is either a control character (like \u0000 or \n) or a non-ascii character. returns -1 if input has no such characters.
returns true if there is an element in first that is also in second. this method terminates if any intersection is found. the sizes of both arguments are assumed to be so small, and the likelihood of an intersection so great, that it is not worth the cpu cost of sorting or the memory cost of hashing.
increments pos until input[pos] is not ascii whitespace. stops at limit.
decrements limit until input[limit - 1] is not ascii whitespace. stops at
encodes an ipv6 address in canonical form according to rfc 5952.
returns an array containing only elements found in first and also in second. the returned elements are in the same order as in first.
closes serversocket, ignoring any checked exceptions. does nothing if serversocket is null.
remove the transmitter from the connection's list of allocations. returns a socket that the caller should close.
returns a new exchange to carry a new request and response.
release the connection if it is no longer needed. this is called after each exchange completes and after the call signals that no more exchanges are expected.
immediately closes the socket connection if it's currently held. use this to interrupt an in-flight request from any thread. it's the caller's responsibility to close the request body and response body streams; otherwise resources may be leaked. this method is safe to be called concurrently, but provides limited guarantees. if a transport layer connection has been established (such as a http2 stream) that is terminated. otherwise if a socket connection is being established, that is terminated.
prepare to create a stream to carry request. this prefers to use the existing connection if it exists.
copy bytecount bytes from the file at pos into to source. it is the caller's responsibility to make sure there are sufficient bytes to read: if there aren't this method throws an eofexception.
write bytecount bytes from source to the file at pos.
creates a new relay that reads a live stream from upstream, using file to share that data with other sources. warning: callers to this method must immediately call #newsource to create a source and close that when they're done. otherwise a handle to file will be leaked.
returns a new source that returns the same bytes as upstream. returns null if this relay has been closed and no further sources are possible. in that case callers should retry after building a new relay with #read.
creates a relay that reads a recorded stream from file. warning: callers to this method must immediately call #newsource to create a source and close that when they're done. otherwise a handle to file will be leaked.
selects where to find the bytes for a read and read them. this is one of three sources. upstream: in this case the current thread is assigned as the upstream reader. we read bytes from upstream and copy them to both the file and to the buffer. finally we release the upstream reader lock and return the new bytes. the file in this case we copy bytes from the file to the sink. the buffer in this case the bytes are immediately copied into sink and the number of bytes copied is returned. if upstream would be selected but another thread is already reading upstream this will block until that read completes. it is possible to time out while waiting for that.
returns the date for value. returns null if the value couldn't be parsed.
returns the path to request, like the '' in 'get http1.1'. never empty, even if the request url is. includes the query component if it exists.
returns the request status line, like "get http1.1". this is exposed to the application by http2.
returns a 'cookie' http request header with all cookies, like a=b; c=d.
figures out the http request to make in response to receiving userresponse. this will either add authentication headers, follow redirects or handle a client request timeout. if a follow-up is either unnecessary or not applicable, this returns null.
report and attempt to recover from a failure to communicate with a server. returns true if be recovered if the body is buffered or if the failure occurred before the request has been sent.
returns true if any commas were skipped.
returns the subset of the headers in response's request that impact the content of response's body.
returns the names of the request headers that need to be checked for equality when caching.
returns true if the response must have a (possibly 0-length) body. see rfc 7231.
parse rfc 7235 challenges. this is awkward because we need to look ahead to know how to interpret a token. for example, the first line has a parameter namevalue pair and the second line has a single token68:  www-authenticate: digest foo=bar www-authenticate: digest foo=  similarly, the first line has one challenge and the second line has two challenges:  www-authenticate: digest ,foo=bar www-authenticate: digest ,foo 
reads a double-quoted string, unescaping quoted pairs like \" to the 2nd character in each sequence. returns the unescaped string, or null if the buffer isn't prefixed with a double-quoted string.
returns the next index in input at or after pos that contains a character from
consumes and returns a non-empty token, terminating at special characters in #token_delimiters. returns null if the buffer is empty or prefixed with a delimiter.
returns the next non-whitespace character in input that is white space. result is undefined if input contains newline characters.
returns the subset of the headers in requestheaders that impact the content of response's body.
returns a request that creates a tls tunnel via an http proxy. everything in the tunnel request is sent unencrypted to the proxy server, so tunnels include only the minimum set of headers. this avoids sending potentially sensitive data like http cookies to the proxy unencrypted. in order to support preemptive authentication we pass a fake “auth failed” response to the authenticator. this gives the authenticator the option to customize the connect request. it can decline to do so by returning null, in which case okhttp will use it as-is
track a failure using this connection. this may prevent both the connection and its route from being used for future exchanges.
returns true if this connection is ready to host new streams.
when settings are received, adjust the allocation limit.
to make an https connection over an http proxy, send an unencrypted connect request to create the proxy connection. this may need to be retried if the proxy requires authorization.
returns true if this connection can carry a stream allocation to address. if non-null
returns true if this connection's route has the same address as any of routes.
does all the work necessary to build a full http or https connection on a raw socket.
does all the work to build an https connection over a proxy tunnel. the catch here is that a proxy server can issue an auth challenge and then close the connection.
notify this pool that connection has become idle. returns true if the connection has been removed from the pool and should be closed.
track a bad route in the route database. other routes will be attempted first.
performs maintenance on this pool, evicting the connection that has been idle the longest if either it has exceeded the keep alive limit or the idle connections limit. returns the duration in nanos to sleep until the next scheduled call to this method. returns -1 if no further cleanups are required.
prunes any leaked transmitters and then returns the number of remaining live transmitters on application code has abandoned them. leak detection is imprecise and relies on garbage collection.
attempts to acquire a recycled connection to address for transmitter. returns true if a connection was acquired. if routes is non-null these are the resolved routes (ie. ip addresses) for the connection. this is used to coalesce related domains to the same http2 connection, such as
reports a failure to complete a connection. determines the next connectionspec to try, if any. #configuresecuresocket(sslsocket) or false if not
returns true if any later connectionspec in the fallback strategy looks possible based on the supplied sslsocket. it assumes that a future socket will have the same capabilities as the supplied socket.
configures the supplied sslsocket to connect to the specified host using an appropriate
returns the next proxy to try. may be proxy.no_proxy but never null.
prepares the socket addresses to attempt for the current proxy or host.
prepares the proxy servers to try.
finds a connection and returns it if it is healthy. if it is unhealthy the process is repeated until a healthy connection is found.
returns a connection to host a new stream. this prefers the existing connection if it exists, then the pool, finally building a new connection.
returns true if certificate matches ipaddress.
returns true iff hostname matches the domain name pattern. .android.com.
returns true if certificate matches hostname.
returns a cleaned chain for chain. this method throws if the complete chain to a trusted ca certificate cannot be constructed. this is unexpected unless the trust root index in this class has a different trust manager than what was used to establish chain.
returns true if toverify was signed by signingcert's public key.
parses the dn and returns the most significant attribute value for an attribute type, or null if none found.
returns a new source that writes bytes to cacherequest as they are read by the source consumer. this is careful to discard bytes left over when the stream is closed; otherwise we may never exhaust the source stream and therefore not complete the cached response.
combines cached headers with a network headers as defined by rfc 7234, 4.3.4.
returns an iterator over the cache's current entries. this iterator doesn't throw concurrentmodificationexception, but if new entries are added while iterating, those new entries will not be returned by the iterator. if existing entries are removed during iteration, they will be absent (unless they were already returned). if there are io problems during iteration, this iterator fails silently. for example, if the hosting filesystem becomes unreachable, the iterator will omit elements rather than throwing exceptions. the caller must snapshot#close close each snapshot returned by the returned iterator supports iterator#remove.
returns a snapshot of the entry named key, or null if it doesn't exist is not currently readable. if a value is returned, it is moved to the head of the lru queue.
create a cache which will reside in directory. this cache is lazily initialized on first access and will be created if it does not exist.
append space-prefixed lengths to writer.
returns an unbuffered input stream to read the last committed value, or null if no value has been committed.
deletes all stored values from the cache. in-flight edits will complete normally but their values will not be stored.
closes this cache. stored values will remain on the filesystem.
we only rebuild the journal when it will halve the size of the journal and eliminate at least 2000 ops.
aborts this edit. this releases the edit lock so another edit may be started on the same key.
commits this edit so it is visible to readers. this releases the edit lock so another edit may be started on the same key.
creates a new journal that omits redundant information. this replaces the current journal if it exists.
computes the initial size and collects garbage as a part of opening the cache. dirty entries are assumed to be inconsistent and will be deleted.
force buffered operations to the filesystem.
returns a new unbuffered output stream to write the value at index. if the underlying output stream encounters errors when writing to the filesystem, this edit will be aborted when #commit is called. the returned output stream does not throw ioexceptions.
returns a snapshot of this entry. this opens all streams eagerly to guarantee that we see a single published snapshot. if we opened streams lazily then the streams could come from different edits.
prevents this editor from completing normally. this is necessary either when the edit causes an io error, or if the target entry is evicted while this editor is active. in either case we delete the editor's created files and prevent new files from being created. note that once an editor has been detached it is possible for another editor to edit the entry.
changes the maximum number of bytes the cache can store and queues a job to trim the existing store, if necessary.
drops the entry for key if it exists and can be removed. if the entry for key is currently being edited, that edit will complete normally but its value will not be stored.
returns a strategy to use assuming the request can use the network.
returns true if response can be stored to later serve another request.
returns a strategy to satisfy request using the a cached response response.
returns the number of milliseconds that the response was fresh for, starting from the served date.
for testing: force this web socket to release its threads.
attempts to remove a single frame from a queue and send it. this prefers to write urgent pongs before less urgent messages and close frames. for example it's possible that a caller will enqueue messages followed by pongs, but this sends pongs followed by messages. pongs are always written in the order they were enqueued. if a frame cannot be sent - because there are none enqueued or because the web socket is not connected - this does nothing and returns false. otherwise this returns true and the caller should immediately invoke this method again until it returns false. this method may only be invoked by the writer thread. there may be only thread invoking this method at a time.
receive frames until there are no more. invoked only by the reader thread.
for testing: receive a single frame and return true if there are more frames to read. invoked only by the reader thread.
stream a message payload as a series of frames. this allows control frames to be interleaved between parts of the message.
send a close frame with optional code and reason. href="http:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6455#section-7.4">section 7.4 of rfc 6455 or 0.
reads a message body into across one or more frames. control frames that occur between fragments will be processed. if the message payload is masked this will unmask as it's being processed.
attempt to match the host runtime to a capable platform implementation.
returns an object that holds a stack trace created at the moment this method is executed. this should be used specifically for java.io.closeable objects and in conjunction with
returns the concatenation of 8-bit, length prefixed protocol names. http:tools.ietf.orghtmldraft-agl-tls-nextprotoneg-04#page-4
sets the delegate of timeout to timeout#none and resets its underlying timeout to the default configuration. use this to avoid unexpected sharing of timeouts between pooled connections.
reads headers or trailers.
returns bytes of a request header for sending on an http transport.
the response body from a connect should be empty, but if it is not then we should consume it before proceeding.
closes the cache entry and makes the socket available for reuse. this should be invoked when the end of the body has been reached.
except for in tests that don't check for a connection preface.
callers of this method are not thread safe, and sometimes on application threads. most often, this method will be called to send a buffer worth of data to the peer. writes are subject to the write window of the stream and the connection. until there is a window sufficient to send bytecount, the caller will block. for example, a user of write window will block. zero bytecount writes are not subject to flow control and will not block. the only use case for zero bytecount is closing a flushed output stream.
degrades this connection such that new streams can neither be created locally, nor accepted from the remote peer. existing streams are not impacted. this is intended to permit an endpoint to gracefully stop accepting new requests without harming previously established streams.
eagerly reads bytecount bytes from the source before launching a background task to process the data. this avoids corrupting the stream.
returns a new server-initiated stream. corresponds to flag_fin.
merges settings into this peer's settings and sends them to the remote peer.
returns headers for a name value block containing an http2 response.
creates a frame reader with max header table size of 4096.
like #wait, but throws an interruptedioexception when interrupted instead of the more awkward interruptedexception.
accept headers from the network and store them until the client calls #takeheaders, or
returns the trailers. it is only safe to call this once the source stream has been completely exhausted.
abnormally terminate this stream. this enqueues a rst_stream frame and returns immediately.
returns a sink that can be used to write data to the peer. #writeheaders has not yet been sent.
returns true if this stream was closed.
removes and returns the stream's received response headers, blocking if necessary until headers have been received. if the returned list contains multiple blocks of headers the blocks will be delimited by 'null'.
abnormally terminate this stream. this blocks until the rst_stream frame has been transmitted.
emit a single data frame to the connection. the frame's size be limited by this stream's write window. this method will block until the write window is nonempty.
sends a reply to an incoming stream. corresponds to flag_fin. response body exists and will be written immediately.
an http2 response cannot contain uppercase header characters and must be treated as malformed.
reads a potentially huffman encoded byte string.
read bytecount bytes of headers from the source stream. this implementation does not propagate the never indexed flag of a header.
index == -1 when new.
writes other into this. if any setting is populated by this and other, the value and flags from other will be kept.
http2 only. send a push promise header block. a push promise contains all the headers that pertain to a server-initiated request, and a sent as a part of the response to streamid. the promisedstreamid has a priority of one greater than streamid. and :path.
send a connection-level ping to the peer. ack indicates this is a reply. the data in
inform peer that an additional windowsizeincrement bytes can be sent on streamid, or the connection if streamid is zero.
implementations must send multiple frames as necessary. #maxdatalength.
write okhttp's settings to the peer.
tell the peer to stop creating streams and that we last processed lastgoodstreamid, or zero if no streams were processed.
applies peersettings and then sends a settings ack.
construct an internal node.
visible for testing.
returns the effective top-level domain plus one (etld+1) by referencing the public suffix list. returns null if the domain is a public suffix or a private address. here are some examples:  assertequals("google.com", geteffectivetldplusone("google.com")); assertequals("google.com", geteffectivetldplusone("www.google.com")); assertnull(geteffectivetldplusone("com")); assertnull(geteffectivetldplusone("localhost")); assertnull(geteffectivetldplusone("mymacbook"));  encoded.
adds a subject alternative name (san) to the certificate. this is usually a literal hostname, a literal ip address, or a hostname pattern. if no subject alternative names are added that extension will be omitted.
set this certificate to be a signing certificate, with up to maxintermediatecas intermediate signing certificates beneath it. by default this certificate cannot not sign other certificates. set this to 0 so this certificate can sign other certificates (but those certificates cannot themselves sign certificates). set this to 1 so this certificate can sign intermediate certificates that can themselves sign certificates. add one for each additional layer of intermediates to permit.
returns the rsa private key encoded in  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5208">pkcs #8  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc7468">pem format.
returns the rsa private key encoded in  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc8017">pkcs #1  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc7468">pem format.
returns the certificate encoded in  href="https:tools.ietf.orghtmlrfc7468">pem format.
sets the certificate to be valid in [notbefore..notafter]. both endpoints are specified in the format of system#currenttimemillis(). specify -1l for both values to use the default interval, 24 hours starting when the certificate is created.
configure the certificate chain to use when being authenticated. the first certificate is the held certificate, further certificates are included in the handshake so the peer can build a trusted path to a trusted root certificate. the chain should include all intermediate certificates but does not need the root certificate that we expect to be known by the remote peer. the peer already has that certificate so transmitting it is unnecessary.
returns an ssl client for this host's localhost address.
returns a trust manager that trusts trustedcertificates.
returns a key manager for the held certificate and its chain. returns an empty key manager if
indicates the protocols supported by alpn on incoming https connections. this list is ignored when #setprotocolnegotiationenabled negotiation is disabled.
returns a url for connecting to this server.
reads a request and writes its response. returns true if further calls should be attempted on the socket.
starts the server and binds to the given socket address.
transfer bytes from source to sink until either bytecount bytes have been transferred or source is exhausted. the transfer is throttled according to policy.
respond to connect requests until a switch_to_ssl_at_end response is dispatched.
sets the response body to body, chunked every maxchunksize bytes.
returns once the duplex conversation completes successfully.
